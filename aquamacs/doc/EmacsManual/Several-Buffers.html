<h3 class="section">23.5 Operating on Several Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-buffer-menu-1087"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x buffer-menu</kbd><dd>Begin editing a buffer listing all Emacs buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x buffer-menu-other-window.</kbd><dd>Similar, but do it in another window. 
</dl>

   <p>The <dfn>buffer menu</dfn> opened by <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> (see <a href="List-Buffers.html#List-Buffers">List Buffers</a>)
does not merely list buffers.  It also allows you to perform various
operations on buffers, through an interface similar to Dired
(see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).  You can save buffers, kill them (here called
<dfn>deleting</dfn> them, for consistency with Dired), or display them.

   <p><a name="index-buffer_002dmenu-1088"></a><a name="index-buffer_002dmenu_002dother_002dwindow-1089"></a>  To use the buffer menu, type <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd> and switch to the window
displaying the `<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer List*</span></samp>' buffer.  You can also type
<kbd>M-x buffer-menu</kbd> to open the buffer menu in the selected window. 
Alternatively, the command <kbd>M-x buffer-menu-other-window</kbd> opens
the buffer menu in another window, and selects that window.

   <p>The buffer menu is a read-only buffer, and can be changed only
through the special commands described in this section.  The usual
Emacs cursor motion commands can be used in this buffer.  The
following commands apply to the buffer described on the current line:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Request to delete (kill) the buffer, then move down.  The request
shows as a `<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>' on the line, before the buffer name.  Requested
deletions take place when you type the <kbd>x</kbd> command. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>d</kbd> but move up afterwards instead of down. 
<br><dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Request to save the buffer.  The request shows as an `<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>' on the
line.  Requested saves take place when you type the <kbd>x</kbd> command. 
You may request both saving and deletion for the same buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Perform previously requested deletions and saves. 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Remove any request made for the current line, and move down. 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Move to previous line and remove any request made for that line. 
</dl>

   <p>The <kbd>d</kbd>, <kbd>C-d</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd> and <kbd>u</kbd> commands to add or remove
flags also move down (or up) one line.  They accept a numeric argument
as a repeat count.

   <p>These commands operate immediately on the buffer listed on the current
line:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>~</kbd><dd>Mark the buffer &ldquo;unmodified.&rdquo;  The command <kbd>~</kbd> does this
immediately when you type it. 
<br><dt><kbd>%</kbd><dd>Toggle the buffer's read-only flag.  The command <kbd>%</kbd> does
this immediately when you type it. 
<br><dt><kbd>t</kbd><dd>Visit the buffer as a tags table.  See <a href="Select-Tags-Table.html#Select-Tags-Table">Select Tags Table</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>There are also commands to select another buffer or buffers:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd>Quit the buffer menu&mdash;immediately display the most recent formerly
visible buffer in its place. 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Immediately select this line's buffer in place of the `<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer
List*</span></samp>' buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>o</kbd><dd>Immediately select this line's buffer in another window as if by
<kbd>C-x 4 b</kbd>, leaving `<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer List*</span></samp>' visible. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-o</kbd><dd>Immediately display this line's buffer in another window, but don't
select the window. 
<br><dt><kbd>1</kbd><dd>Immediately select this line's buffer in a full-screen window. 
<br><dt><kbd>2</kbd><dd>Immediately set up two windows, with this line's buffer selected in
one, and the previously current buffer (aside from the buffer
`<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer List*</span></samp>') displayed in the other. 
<br><dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd>Bury the buffer listed on this line. 
<br><dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd>Mark this line's buffer to be displayed in another window if you exit
with the <kbd>v</kbd> command.  The request shows as a `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>' at the
beginning of the line.  (A single buffer may not have both a delete
request and a display request.) 
<br><dt><kbd>v</kbd><dd>Immediately select this line's buffer, and also display in other windows
any buffers previously marked with the <kbd>m</kbd> command.  If you have not
marked any buffers, this command is equivalent to <kbd>1</kbd>. 
</dl>

   <p>There is also a command that affects the entire buffer list:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>T</kbd><dd>Delete, or reinsert, lines for non-file buffers.  This command toggles
the inclusion of such buffers in the buffer list. 
</dl>

   <p>What <code>buffer-menu</code> actually does is create and switch to a
suitable buffer, and turn on Buffer Menu mode in it.  Everything else
described above is implemented by the special commands provided in
Buffer Menu mode.  One consequence of this is that you can switch from
the `<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer List*</span></samp>' buffer to another Emacs buffer, and edit
there.  You can reselect the `<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer List*</span></samp>' buffer later, to
perform the operations already requested, or you can kill it, or pay
no further attention to it.

   <p>Normally, the buffer `<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer List*</span></samp>' is not updated
automatically when buffers are created and killed; its contents are
just text.  If you have created, deleted or renamed buffers, the way
to update `<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer List*</span></samp>' to show what you have done is to type
<kbd>g</kbd> (<code>revert-buffer</code>).  You can make this happen regularly
every <code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds if you enable Auto Revert
mode in this buffer, as long as it is not marked modified.  Global
Auto Revert mode applies to the `<samp><span class="samp">*Buffer List*</span></samp>' buffer only if
<code>global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers</code> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
See <a href="Autorevert.html#Autorevert">global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers</a>, for details.
