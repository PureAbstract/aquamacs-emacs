<h3 class="section">Exiting Emacs</h3>

<p>There are two commands for exiting Emacs because there are two kinds
of exiting: <dfn>suspending</dfn> Emacs and <dfn>killing</dfn> Emacs.

   <p><dfn>Suspending</dfn> means stopping Emacs temporarily and returning
control to its parent process (usually a shell), allowing you to resume
editing later in the same Emacs job, with the same buffers, same kill
ring, same undo history, and so on.  This is the usual way to exit.

   <p><dfn>Killing</dfn> Emacs means destroying the Emacs job.  You can run Emacs
again later, but you will get a fresh Emacs; there is no way to resume
the same editing session after it has been killed.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-z</kbd>
     <dd>Suspend Emacs (<code>suspend-emacs</code>) or iconify a frame
(<code>iconify-or-deiconify-frame</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>
     <dd>Kill Emacs (<code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>To suspend Emacs, type <kbd>C-z</kbd> (<code>suspend-emacs</code>).  This takes
you back to the shell from which you invoked Emacs.  You can resume
Emacs with the shell command <code>%emacs</code> in most common shells.

   <p>On systems that do not support suspending programs, <kbd>C-z</kbd> starts
an inferior shell that communicates directly with the terminal. 
Emacs waits until you exit the subshell.  (The way to do that is
probably with <kbd>C-d</kbd> or <code>exit</code>, but it depends on which shell
you use.)  The only way on these systems to get back to the shell from
which Emacs was run (to log out, for example) is to kill Emacs.

   <p>Suspending also fails if you run Emacs under a shell that doesn't
support suspending programs, even if the system itself does support it. 
In such a case, you can set the variable <code>cannot-suspend</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value to force <kbd>C-z</kbd> to start an inferior shell. 
(One might also describe Emacs's parent shell as "inferior" for
failing to support job control properly, but that is a matter of taste.)

   <p>When Emacs communicates directly with an X server and creates its own
dedicated X windows, <kbd>C-z</kbd> has a different meaning.  Suspending an
application that uses its own X windows is not meaningful or useful. 
Instead, <kbd>C-z</kbd> runs the command <code>iconify-or-deiconify-frame</code>,
which temporarily iconifies (or "minimizes") the selected Emacs
frame (see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>).  Then you can use the window manager to get
back to a shell window.

   <p>To exit and kill Emacs, type <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd>
(<code>save-buffers-kill-emacs</code>).  A two-character key is used for
this to make it harder to type by accident.  This command first offers
to save any modified file-visiting buffers.  If you do not save them
all, it asks for reconfirmation with <kbd>yes</kbd> before killing Emacs,
since any changes not saved will be lost forever.  Also, if any
subprocesses are still running, <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> asks for confirmation
about them, since killing Emacs will also kill the subprocesses.

   <p>If the value of the variable <code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> assumes that its value is a predicate
function, and calls that function.  If the result is non-<code>nil</code>, the
session is killed, otherwise Emacs continues to run.  One convenient
function to use as the value of <code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is the
function <code>yes-or-no-p</code>.  The default value of
<code>confirm-kill-emacs</code> is <code>nil</code>.

   <p>There is no way to resume an Emacs session once you have killed it. 
You can, however, arrange for Emacs to record certain session
information when you kill it, such as which files are visited, so that
the next time you start Emacs it will try to visit the same files and
so on.  See <a href="Saving-Emacs-Sessions.html#Saving%20Emacs%20Sessions">Saving Emacs Sessions</a>.

   <p>The operating system usually listens for certain special characters
whose meaning is to kill or suspend the program you are running. 
<b>This operating system feature is turned off while you are in Emacs.</b>
The meanings of <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> as keys in Emacs were
inspired by the use of <kbd>C-z</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> on several operating
systems as the characters for stopping or killing a program, but that is
their only relationship with the operating system.  You can customize
these keys to run any commands of your choice (see <a href="Keymaps.html#Keymaps">Keymaps</a>).
