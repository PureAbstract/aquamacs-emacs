<h3 class="section">The Menu Bar</h3>

<p>Each Emacs frame normally has a <dfn>menu bar</dfn> at the top which you
can use to perform certain common operations.  There's no need to list
them here, as you can more easily see for yourself.

   <p>When you are using a window system, you can use the mouse to choose a
command from the menu bar.  An arrow pointing right, after the menu
item, indicates that the item leads to a subsidiary menu; <code>...</code> at
the end means that the command will read arguments from the keyboard
before it actually does anything.

   <p>To view the full command name and documentation for a menu item, type
<kbd>C-h k</kbd>, and then select the menu bar with the mouse in the usual
way (see <a href="Key-Help.html#Key%20Help">Key Help</a>).

   <p>On text-only terminals with no mouse, you can use the menu bar by
typing <kbd>M-`</kbd> or &lt;F10&gt; (these run the command
<code>tmm-menubar</code>).  This command enters a mode in which you can select
a menu item from the keyboard.  A provisional choice appears in the echo
area.  You can use the left and right arrow keys to move through the
menu to different choices.  When you have found the choice you want,
type &lt;RET&gt; to select it.

   <p>Each menu item also has an assigned letter or digit which designates
that item; it is usually the initial of some word in the item's name. 
This letter or digit is separated from the item name by <code>=&gt;</code>.  You
can type the item's letter or digit to select the item.

   <p>Some of the commands in the menu bar have ordinary key bindings as
well; if so, the menu lists one equivalent key binding in parentheses
after the item itself.
