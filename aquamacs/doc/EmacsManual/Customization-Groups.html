<h3 class="subsubsection">Customization Groups</h5>

<p>For customization purposes, user options are organized into
<dfn>groups</dfn> to help you find them.  Groups are collected into bigger
groups, all the way up to a master group called <code>Emacs</code>.

   <p><kbd>M-x customize</kbd> creates a customization buffer that shows the
top-level <code>Emacs</code> group and the second-level groups immediately
under it.  It looks like this, in part:

<pre class="smallexample">     /- Emacs group: ---------------------------------------------------\
           [State]: visible group members are all at standard settings.
        Customization of the One True Editor.
        See also [Manual].
     
     Confirm Kill Emacs: [Hide] [Value Menu] Don't confirm
        [State]: this option is unchanged from its standard setting.
     How to ask for confirmation when leaving Emacs. [More]
     
     Editing group: [Go to Group]
     Basic text editing facilities.
     
     External group: [Go to Group]
     Interfacing to external utilities.
     
     <var>more second-level groups</var>
     
     \- Emacs group end ------------------------------------------------/
     
     </pre>

<p>This says that the buffer displays the contents of the <code>Emacs</code>
group.  The other groups are listed because they are its contents.  But
they are listed differently, without indentation and dashes, because
<em>their</em> contents are not included.  Each group has a single-line
documentation string; the <code>Emacs</code> group also has a <code>[State]</code>
line.

   <p>Most of the text in the customization buffer is read-only, but it
typically includes some <dfn>editable fields</dfn> that you can edit.  There
are also <dfn>active fields</dfn>; this means a field that does something
when you <dfn>invoke</dfn> it.  To invoke an active field, either click on it
with <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, or move point to it and type &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>For example, the phrase <code>[Go to Group]</code> that appears in a
second-level group is an active field.  Invoking the <code>[Go to
Group]</code> field for a group creates a new customization buffer, which
shows that group and its contents.  This field is a kind of hypertext
link to another group.

   <p>The <code>Emacs</code> group includes a few user options itself, but
mainly it contains other groups, which contain more groups, which
contain the user options.  By browsing the hierarchy of groups, you
will eventually find the feature you are interested in customizing. 
Then you can use the customization buffer to set the options and faces
pertaining to that feature.  You can also go straight to a particular
group by name, using the command <kbd>M-x customize-group</kbd>.

   <p>You can view the structure of customization groups on a larger scale
with <kbd>M-x customize-browse</kbd>.  This command creates a special kind of
customization buffer which shows only the names of the groups (and
options and faces), and their structure.

   <p>In this buffer, you can show the contents of a group by invoking
<code>[+]</code>.  When the group contents are visible, this button changes to
<code>[-]</code>; invoking that hides the group contents.

   <p>Each group, option or face name in this buffer has an active field
which says <code>[Group]</code>, <code>[Option]</code> or <code>[Face]</code>.  Invoking
that active field creates an ordinary customization buffer showing just
that group and its contents, just that option, or just that face. 
This is the way to set values in it.
