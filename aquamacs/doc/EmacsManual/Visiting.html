   <p><dfn>Visiting</dfn> a file means copying its contents into an Emacs
buffer so you can edit them.  Emacs makes a new buffer for each file
that you visit.  We often say that this buffer "is visiting" that
file, or that the buffer's "visited file" is that file.  Emacs
constructs the buffer name from the file name by throwing away the
directory, keeping just the name proper.  For example, a file named
<code>/usr/rms/emacs.tex</code> would get a buffer named <code>emacs.tex</code>. 
If there is already a buffer with that name, Emacs constructs a unique
name--the normal method is to append <code>&lt;2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;3&gt;</code>, and so
on, but you can select other methods (see <a href="Uniquify.html#Uniquify">Uniquify</a>).

   <p>Each window's mode line shows the name of the buffer that is being displayed
in that window, so you can always tell what buffer you are editing.

   <p>The changes you make with editing commands are made in the Emacs
buffer.  They do not take effect in the file that you visited, or any
place permanent, until you <dfn>save</dfn> the buffer.  Saving the buffer
means that Emacs writes the current contents of the buffer into its
visited file.  See <a href="Saving.html#Saving">Saving</a>.

   <p>If a buffer contains changes that have not been saved, we say the
buffer is <dfn>modified</dfn>.  This is important because it implies that
some changes will be lost if the buffer is not saved.  The mode line
displays two stars near the left margin to indicate that the buffer is
modified.

   <p>To visit a file, use the command <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>).  Follow
the command with the name of the file you wish to visit, terminated by a
&lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>The file name is read using the minibuffer (see <a href="Minibuffer.html#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>), with
defaulting and completion in the standard manner (see <a href="File-Names.html#File%20Names">File Names</a>). 
While in the minibuffer, you can abort <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> by typing
<kbd>C-g</kbd>.  File-name completion ignores certain filenames; for more
about this, see <a href="Completion-Options.html#Completion%20Options">Completion Options</a>.

   <p>When Emacs is built with a suitable GUI toolkit, it pops up the
standard File Selection dialog of that toolkit instead of prompting for
the file name in the minibuffer.  On Unix and GNU/Linux platforms, Emacs
does that when built with LessTif and Motif toolkits; on MS-Windows, the
GUI version does that by default.

   <p>Your confirmation that <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> has completed successfully is the
appearance of new text on the screen and a new buffer name in the mode
line.  If the specified file does not exist and could not be created, or
cannot be read, then you get an error, with an error message displayed
in the echo area.

   <p>If you visit a file that is already in Emacs, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> does not make
another copy.  It selects the existing buffer containing that file. 
However, before doing so, it checks that the file itself has not changed
since you visited or saved it last.  If the file has changed, a warning
message is shown.  See <a href="Interlocking.html#Interlocking">Simultaneous Editing</a>.

   <p>Since Emacs reads the visited file in its entirety, files whose size
is larger than the maximum Emacs buffer size (see <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>) cannot be
visited; if you try, Emacs will display an error message saying that the
maximum buffer size has been exceeded.

   <p>What if you want to create a new file?  Just visit it.  Emacs displays
<code>(New file)</code> in the echo area, but in other respects behaves as if
you had visited an existing empty file.  If you make any changes and
save them, the file is created.

   <p>Emacs recognizes from the contents of a file which convention it uses
to separate lines--newline (used on GNU/Linux and on Unix),
carriage-return linefeed (used on Microsoft systems), or just
carriage-return (used on the Macintosh)--and automatically converts the
contents to the normal Emacs convention, which is that the newline
character separates lines.  This is a part of the general feature of
coding system conversion (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding%20Systems">Coding Systems</a>), and makes it possible
to edit files imported from different operating systems with
equal convenience.  If you change the text and save the file, Emacs
performs the inverse conversion, changing newlines back into
carriage-return linefeed or just carriage-return if appropriate.

   <p>If the file you specify is actually a directory, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> invokes
Dired, the Emacs directory browser, so that you can "edit" the contents
of the directory (see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).  Dired is a convenient way to delete,
look at, or operate on the files in the directory.  However, if the
variable <code>find-file-run-dired</code> is <code>nil</code>, then it is an error
to try to visit a directory.

   <p>Files which are actually collections of other files, or <dfn>file
archives</dfn>, are visited in special modes which invoke a Dired-like
environment to allow operations on archive members.  See <a href="File-Archives.html#File%20Archives">File Archives</a>, for more about these features.

   <p>If the file name you specify contains shell-style wildcard characters,
Emacs visits all the files that match it.  Wildcards include <code>?</code>,
<code>*</code>, and <code>[...]</code> sequences.  See <a href="Quoted-File-Names.html#Quoted%20File%20Names">Quoted File Names</a>, for
information on how to visit a file whose name actually contains wildcard
characters.  You can disable the wildcard feature by customizing
<code>find-file-wildcards</code>.

   <p>If you visit a file that the operating system won't let you modify,
Emacs makes the buffer read-only, so that you won't go ahead and make
changes that you'll have trouble saving afterward.  You can make the
buffer writable with <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> (<code>vc-toggle-read-only</code>). 
See <a href="Misc-Buffer.html#Misc%20Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.

   <p>Occasionally you might want to visit a file as read-only in order to
protect yourself from entering changes accidentally; do so by visiting
the file with the command <kbd>C-x C-r</kbd> (<code>find-file-read-only</code>).

   <p>If you visit a nonexistent file unintentionally (because you typed the
wrong file name), use the <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> command
(<code>find-alternate-file</code>) to visit the file you really wanted. 
<kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> is similar to <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, but it kills the current
buffer (after first offering to save it if it is modified).  When
<kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> reads the file name to visit, it inserts the entire
default file name in the buffer, with point just after the directory
part; this is convenient if you made a slight error in typing the name.

   <p>If you find a file which exists but cannot be read, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
signals an error.

   <p><kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-window</code>) is like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
except that the buffer containing the specified file is selected in another
window.  The window that was selected before <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> continues to
show the same buffer it was already showing.  If this command is used when
only one window is being displayed, that window is split in two, with one
window showing the same buffer as before, and the other one showing the
newly requested file.  See <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p><kbd>C-x 5 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-frame</code>) is similar, but opens a
new frame, or makes visible any existing frame showing the file you
seek.  This feature is available only when you are using a window
system.  See <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>.

   <p>If you wish to edit a file as a sequence of ASCII characters with no special
encoding or conversion, use the <kbd>M-x find-file-literally</kbd> command. 
It visits a file, like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, but does not do format conversion
(see <a href="Formatted-Text.html#Formatted%20Text">Formatted Text</a>), character code conversion (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding%20Systems">Coding Systems</a>), or automatic uncompression (see <a href="Compressed-Files.html#Compressed%20Files">Compressed Files</a>), and
does not add a final newline because of <code>require-final-newline</code>. 
If you already have visited the same file in the usual (non-literal)
manner, this command asks you whether to visit it literally instead.

   <p>Two special hook variables allow extensions to modify the operation of
visiting files.  Visiting a file that does not exist runs the functions
in the list <code>find-file-not-found-hooks</code>; this variable holds a list
of functions, and the functions are called one by one (with no
arguments) until one of them returns non-<code>nil</code>.  This is not a
normal hook, and the name ends in <code>-hooks</code> rather than <code>-hook</code>
to indicate that fact.

   <p>Successful visiting of any file, whether existing or not, calls the
functions in the list <code>find-file-hooks</code>, with no arguments. 
This variable is really a normal hook, but it has an abnormal name for
historical compatibility.  In the case of a nonexistent file, the
<code>find-file-not-found-hooks</code> are run first.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

   <p>There are several ways to specify automatically the major mode for
editing the file (see <a href="Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing%20Modes">Choosing Modes</a>), and to specify local
variables defined for that file (see <a href="File-Variables.html#File%20Variables">File Variables</a>).
