<h3 class="section">Appointments</h3>

<p>If you have a diary entry for an appointment, and that diary entry
begins with a recognizable time of day, Emacs can warn you several
minutes beforehand that that appointment is pending.  Emacs alerts you
to the appointment by displaying a message in the mode line.

   <p>To enable appointment notification, you must enable the time display
feature of Emacs, <kbd>M-x display-time</kbd> (see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode%20Line">Mode Line</a>).  You must
also add the function <code>appt-make-list</code> to the
<code>diary-hook</code>, like this:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'diary-hook 'appt-make-list)
     </pre>

<p>Adding this text to your <code>.emacs</code> file does the whole job:

<pre class="example">     (display-time)
     (add-hook 'diary-hook 'appt-make-list)
     (diary 0)
     </pre>

   <p>With these preparations done, when you display the diary (either with
the <kbd>d</kbd> command in the calendar window or with the <kbd>M-x diary</kbd>
command), it sets up an appointment list of all the diary entries found
with recognizable times of day, and reminds you just before each of
them.

   <p>For example, suppose the diary file contains these lines:

<pre class="example">     Monday
       9:30am Coffee break
      12:00pm Lunch
     </pre>

<p>Then on Mondays, after you have displayed the diary, you will be
reminded at 9:20am about your coffee break and at 11:50am about lunch.

   <p>You can write times in am/pm style (with <code>12:00am</code> standing
for midnight and <code>12:00pm</code> standing for noon), or 24-hour
European/military style.  You need not be consistent; your diary file
can have a mixture of the two styles.

   <p>Emacs updates the appointments list automatically just after
midnight.  This also displays the next day's diary entries in the diary
buffer, unless you set <code>appt-display-diary</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>You can also use the appointment notification facility like an alarm
clock.  The command <kbd>M-x appt-add</kbd> adds entries to the appointment
list without affecting your diary file.  You delete entries from the
appointment list with <kbd>M-x appt-delete</kbd>.

   <p>You can turn off the appointment notification feature at any time by
setting <code>appt-issue-message</code> to <code>nil</code>.
