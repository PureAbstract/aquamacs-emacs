<p>Deletion means erasing text and not saving it in the kill ring.  For
the most part, the Emacs commands that delete text are those that
erase just one character or only whitespace.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-d</kbd>
     <dd><dt><kbd>&lt;Delete&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Delete next character (<code>delete-char</code>).  If your keyboard has a
&lt;Delete&gt; function key (usually located in the edit keypad), Emacs
binds it to <code>delete-char</code> as well. 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>
     <dd><dt><kbd>&lt;BS&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Delete previous character (<code>delete-backward-char</code>).  Some keyboards
refer to this key as a "backspace key" and label it with a left arrow. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-\</kbd>
     <dd>Delete spaces and tabs around point (<code>delete-horizontal-space</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Delete spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space
(<code>just-one-space</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-o</kbd>
     <dd>Delete blank lines around the current line (<code>delete-blank-lines</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-^</kbd>
     <dd>Join two lines by deleting the intervening newline, along with any
indentation following it (<code>delete-indentation</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The most basic delete commands are <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>delete-char</code>) and
&lt;DEL&gt; (<code>delete-backward-char</code>).  <kbd>C-d</kbd> deletes the
character after point, the one the cursor is "on top of."  This
doesn't move point.  &lt;DEL&gt; deletes the character before the cursor,
and moves point back.  You can delete newlines like any other characters
in the buffer; deleting a newline joins two lines.  Actually, <kbd>C-d</kbd>
and &lt;DEL&gt; aren't always delete commands; when given arguments, they
kill instead, since they can erase more than one character this way.

   <p>Every keyboard has a large key, labeled &lt;DEL&gt;, &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;,
&lt;BS&gt; or &lt;DELETE&gt;, which is a short distance above the
&lt;RET&gt; or &lt;ENTER&gt; key and is normally used for erasing what you
have typed.  Regardless of the actual name on the key, in Emacs it is
equivalent to &lt;DEL&gt;--or it should be.

   <p>Many keyboards (including standard PC keyboards) have a
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key a short ways above &lt;RET&gt; or &lt;ENTER&gt;, and a
&lt;DELETE&gt; key elsewhere.  In that case, the &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key is
&lt;DEL&gt;, and the &lt;DELETE&gt; key is equivalent to <kbd>C-d</kbd>--or it
should be.

   <p>Why do we say "or it should be"?  When Emacs starts up using a
window system, it determines automatically which key or keys should be
equivalent to &lt;DEL&gt;.  As a result, &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; and/or &lt;DELETE&gt;
keys normally do the right things.  But in some unusual cases Emacs
gets the wrong information from the system.  If these keys don't do
what they ought to do, you need to tell Emacs which key to use for
&lt;DEL&gt;.  See <a href="DEL-Does-Not-Delete.html#DEL%20Does%20Not%20Delete">DEL Does Not Delete</a>, for how to do this.

   <p>On most text-only terminals, Emacs cannot tell which keys the
keyboard really has, so it follows a uniform plan which may or may not
fit your keyboard.  The uniform plan is that the ASCII &lt;DEL&gt;
character deletes, and the ASCII &lt;BS&gt; (backspace) character asks
for help (it is the same as <kbd>C-h</kbd>).  If this is not right for your
keyboard, such as if you find that the key which ought to delete backwards
enters Help instead, see <a href="DEL-Does-Not-Delete.html#DEL%20Does%20Not%20Delete">DEL Does Not Delete</a>.

   <p>The other delete commands are those which delete only whitespace
characters: spaces, tabs and newlines.  <kbd>M-\</kbd>
(<code>delete-horizontal-space</code>) deletes all the spaces and tab
characters before and after point.  <kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>just-one-space</code>) does likewise but leaves a single space after
point, regardless of the number of spaces that existed previously (even
if there were none before).

   <p><kbd>C-x C-o</kbd> (<code>delete-blank-lines</code>) deletes all blank lines
after the current line.  If the current line is blank, it deletes all
blank lines preceding the current line as well (leaving one blank line,
the current line).

   <p><kbd>M-^</kbd> (<code>delete-indentation</code>) joins the current line and the
previous line, by deleting a newline and all surrounding spaces, usually
leaving a single space.  See <a href="Indentation.html#Indentation">M-^</a>.
