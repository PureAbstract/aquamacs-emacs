<h3 class="section">Quoted File Names</h3>

<p>You can <dfn>quote</dfn> an absolute file name to prevent special
characters and syntax in it from having their special effects. 
The way to do this is to add <code>/:</code> at the beginning.

   <p>For example, you can quote a local file name which appears remote, to
prevent it from being treated as a remote file name.  Thus, if you have
a directory named <code>/foo:</code> and a file named <code>bar</code> in it, you
can refer to that file in Emacs as <code>/:/foo:/bar</code>.

   <p><code>/:</code> can also prevent <code>~</code> from being treated as a special
character for a user's home directory.  For example, <code>/:/tmp/~hack</code>
refers to a file whose name is <code>~hack</code> in directory <code>/tmp</code>.

   <p>Likewise, quoting with <code>/:</code> is one way to enter in the minibuffer
a file name that contains <code>$</code>.  However, the <code>/:</code> must be at
the beginning of the minibuffer in order to quote <code>$</code>.

   <p>You can also quote wildcard characters with <code>/:</code>, for visiting. 
For example, <code>/:/tmp/foo*bar</code> visits the file <code>/tmp/foo*bar</code>. 
However, in most cases you can simply type the wildcard characters for
themselves.  For example, if the only file name in <code>/tmp</code> that
starts with <code>foo</code> and ends with <code>bar</code> is <code>foo*bar</code>, then
specifying <code>/tmp/foo*bar</code> will visit just <code>/tmp/foo*bar</code>. 
Another way is to specify <code>/tmp/foo[*]bar</code>.
