<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.7.2 Creating New Branches</h5>

<p>To create a new branch from a head revision (one that is the latest in
the branch that contains it), first select that revision if necessary,
lock it with <kbd>C-x v v</kbd>, and make whatever changes you want.  Then,
when you check in the changes, use <kbd>C-u C-x v v</kbd>.  This lets you
specify the revision ID for the new revision.  You should specify a
suitable branch ID for a branch starting at the current revision. 
For example, if the current revision is 2.5, the branch ID should be
2.5.1, 2.5.2, and so on, depending on the number of existing branches at
that point.

   <p>To create a new branch at an older revision (one that is no longer the
head of a branch), first select that revision (see <a href="Switching-Branches.html#Switching-Branches">Switching Branches</a>).  Your procedure will then differ depending on whether you
are using a locking or merging-based VCS.

   <p>On a locking VCS, you will need to lock the old revision branch with
<kbd>C-x v v</kbd>.  You'll be asked to confirm, when you lock the old
revision, that you really mean to create a new branch&mdash;if you say no,
you'll be offered a chance to lock the latest revision instead.  On
a merging-based VCS you will skip this step.

   <p>Then make your changes and type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> again to check in a new
revision.  This automatically creates a new branch starting from the
selected revision.  You need not specially request a new branch, because
that's the only way to add a new revision at a point that is not the head
of a branch.

   <p>After the branch is created, you &ldquo;stay&rdquo; on it.  That means that
subsequent check-ins create new revisions on that branch.  To leave the
branch, you must explicitly select a different revision with <kbd>C-u C-x
v v</kbd>.  To transfer changes from one branch to another, use the merge
command, described in the next section.
