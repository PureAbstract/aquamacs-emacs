<h3 class="section">Deletion and Killing</h3>

<p>Most commands which erase text from the buffer save it in the kill
ring so that you can move or copy it to other parts of the buffer. 
These commands are known as <dfn>kill</dfn> commands.  The rest of the
commands that erase text do not save it in the kill ring; they are known
as <dfn>delete</dfn> commands.  (This distinction is made only for erasure of
text in the buffer.)  If you do a kill or delete command by mistake, you
can use the <kbd>C-x u</kbd> (<code>undo</code>) command to undo it
(see <a href="Undo.html#Undo">Undo</a>).

   <p>You cannot kill read-only text, since such text does not allow any
kind of modification.  But some users like to use the kill commands to
copy read-only text into the kill ring, without actually changing it. 
If you set the variable <code>kill-read-only-ok</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value, the kill commands work specially in a read-only buffer: they
move over text, and copy it to the kill ring, without actually
deleting it from the buffer.  When this happens, a message in the echo
area tells you what is happening.

   <p>The delete commands include <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>delete-char</code>) and
&lt;DEL&gt; (<code>delete-backward-char</code>), which delete only one
character at a time, and those commands that delete only spaces or
newlines.  Commands that can destroy significant amounts of nontrivial
data generally do a kill operation instead.  The commands' names and
individual descriptions use the words <code>kill</code> and <code>delete</code> to
say which kind of operation they perform.

   <p>Many window systems follow the convention that insertion while text
is selected deletes the selected text.  You can make Emacs behave this
way by enabling Delete Selection mode, with <kbd>M-x
delete-selection-mode</kbd>, or using Custom.  Another effect of this mode
is that &lt;DEL&gt;, <kbd>C-d</kbd> and some other keys, when a selection
exists, will kill the whole selection.  It also enables Transient Mark
mode (see <a href="Transient-Mark.html#Transient%20Mark">Transient Mark</a>).
