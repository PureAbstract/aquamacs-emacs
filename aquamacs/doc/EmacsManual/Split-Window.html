     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x 2</kbd>
     <dd>Split the selected window into two windows, one above the other
(<code>split-window-vertically</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x 3</kbd>
     <dd>Split the selected window into two windows positioned side by side
(<code>split-window-horizontally</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-Mouse-2</kbd>
     <dd>In the mode line or scroll bar of a window, split that window. 
</dl>

   <p>The command <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> (<code>split-window-vertically</code>) breaks the
selected window into two windows, one above the other.  Both windows start
out displaying the same buffer, with the same value of point.  By default
the two windows each get half the height of the window that was split; a
numeric argument specifies how many lines to give to the top window.

   <p><kbd>C-x 3</kbd> (<code>split-window-horizontally</code>) breaks the selected
window into two side-by-side windows.  A numeric argument specifies how
many columns to give the one on the left.  A line of vertical bars
separates the two windows.  Windows that are not the full width of the
screen have mode lines, but they are truncated.  On terminals where
Emacs does not support highlighting, truncated mode lines sometimes do
not appear in inverse video.

   <p>You can split a window horizontally or vertically by clicking
<kbd>C-Mouse-2</kbd> in the mode line or the scroll bar.  (This does not
work in scroll bars implemented by X toolkits.)  The line of splitting
goes through the place where you click: if you click on the mode line,
the new scroll bar goes above the spot; if you click in the scroll
bar, the mode line of the split window is side by side with your
click.

   <p>When a window is less than the full width, text lines too long to fit are
frequent.  Continuing all those lines might be confusing.  The variable
<code>truncate-partial-width-windows</code> can be set non-<code>nil</code> to force
truncation in all windows less than the full width of the screen,
independent of the buffer being displayed and its value for
<code>truncate-lines</code>.  See <a href="Continuation-Lines.html#Continuation%20Lines">Continuation Lines</a>.

   <p>Horizontal scrolling is often used in side-by-side windows. 
See <a href="Display.html#Display">Display</a>.

   <p>If <code>split-window-keep-point</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the default,
both of the windows resulting from <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> inherit the value of
point from the window that was split.  This means that scrolling is
inevitable.  If this variable is <code>nil</code>, then <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> tries to
avoid scrolling the text currently visible on the screen, by putting
point in each window at a position already visible in the window.  It
also selects whichever window contain the screen line that the cursor
was previously on.  Some users prefer the latter mode on slow
terminals.
