<h3 class="subsection">Auto-Save Files</h4>

<p>Auto-saving does not normally save in the files that you visited, because
it can be very undesirable to save a program that is in an inconsistent
state when you have made half of a planned change.  Instead, auto-saving
is done in a different file called the <dfn>auto-save file</dfn>, and the
visited file is changed only when you request saving explicitly (such as
with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>).

   <p>Normally, the auto-save file name is made by appending <code>#</code> to the
front and rear of the visited file name.  Thus, a buffer visiting file
<code>foo.c</code> is auto-saved in a file <code>#foo.c#</code>.  Most buffers that
are not visiting files are auto-saved only if you request it explicitly;
when they are auto-saved, the auto-save file name is made by appending
<code>#%</code> to the front and <code>#</code> to the rear of buffer name.  For
example, the <code>*mail*</code> buffer in which you compose messages to be
sent is auto-saved in a file named <code>#%*mail*#</code>.  Auto-save file
names are made this way unless you reprogram parts of Emacs to do
something different (the functions <code>make-auto-save-file-name</code> and
<code>auto-save-file-name-p</code>).  The file name to be used for auto-saving
in a buffer is calculated when auto-saving is turned on in that buffer.

   <p>When you delete a substantial part of the text in a large buffer, auto
save turns off temporarily in that buffer.  This is because if you
deleted the text unintentionally, you might find the auto-save file more
useful if it contains the deleted text.  To reenable auto-saving after
this happens, save the buffer with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>, or use <kbd>C-u 1 M-x
auto-save</kbd>.

   <p>If you want auto-saving to be done in the visited file rather than
in a separate auto-save file, set the variable
<code>auto-save-visited-file-name</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  In this
mode, there is no real difference between auto-saving and explicit
saving.

   <p>A buffer's auto-save file is deleted when you save the buffer in its
visited file.  To inhibit this, set the variable <code>delete-auto-save-files</code>
to <code>nil</code>.  Changing the visited file name with <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> or
<code>set-visited-file-name</code> renames any auto-save file to go with
the new visited name.
