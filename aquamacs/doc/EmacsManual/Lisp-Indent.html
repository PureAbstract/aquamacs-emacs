<h3 class="subsection">Customizing Lisp Indentation</h4>

<p>The indentation pattern for a Lisp expression can depend on the function
called by the expression.  For each Lisp function, you can choose among
several predefined patterns of indentation, or define an arbitrary one with
a Lisp program.

   <p>The standard pattern of indentation is as follows: the second line of the
expression is indented under the first argument, if that is on the same
line as the beginning of the expression; otherwise, the second line is
indented underneath the function name.  Each following line is indented
under the previous line whose nesting depth is the same.

   <p>If the variable <code>lisp-indent-offset</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, it overrides
the usual indentation pattern for the second line of an expression, so that
such lines are always indented <code>lisp-indent-offset</code> more columns than
the containing list.

   <p>Certain functions override the standard pattern.  Functions whose
names start with <code>def</code> treat the the second lines as the start of
a <dfn>body</dfn>, by indenting the second line <code>lisp-body-indent</code>
additional columns beyond the open-parenthesis that starts the
expression.

   <p>You can override the standard pattern in various ways for individual
functions, according to the <code>lisp-indent-function</code> property of the
function name.  There are four possibilities for this property:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code>
     <dd>This is the same as no property--use the standard indentation pattern. 
<br><dt><code>defun</code>
     <dd>Handle this function like a <code>def</code> construct: treat the second
line as the start of a <dfn>body</dfn>. 
<br><dt>a number, <var>number</var>
     <dd>The first <var>number</var> arguments of the function are
<dfn>distinguished</dfn> arguments; the rest are considered the body
of the expression.  A line in the expression is indented according to
whether the first argument on it is distinguished or not.  If the
argument is part of the body, the line is indented <code>lisp-body-indent</code>
more columns than the open-parenthesis starting the containing
expression.  If the argument is distinguished and is either the first
or second argument, it is indented <em>twice</em> that many extra columns. 
If the argument is distinguished and not the first or second argument,
the line uses the standard pattern. 
<br><dt>a symbol, <var>symbol</var>
     <dd><var>symbol</var> should be a function name; that function is called to
calculate the indentation of a line within this expression.  The
function receives two arguments:
          <dl>
<dt><var>state</var>
          <dd>The value returned by <code>parse-partial-sexp</code> (a Lisp primitive for
indentation and nesting computation) when it parses up to the
beginning of this line. 
<br><dt><var>pos</var>
          <dd>The position at which the line being indented begins. 
</dl>

     <p>It should return either a number, which is the number of columns of
indentation for that line, or a list whose car is such a number.  The
difference between returning a number and returning a list is that a
number says that all following lines at the same nesting level should
be indented just like this one; a list says that following lines might
call for different indentations.  This makes a difference when the
indentation is being computed by <kbd>C-M-q</kbd>; if the value is a
number, <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> need not recalculate indentation for the following
lines until the end of the list.
