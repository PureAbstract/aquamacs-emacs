<h3 class="subsection">Basic Program Indentation Commands</h4>

<p>The basic indentation commands indent a single line according to the
usual conventions of the language you are editing.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Adjust indentation of current line. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-j</kbd>
     <dd>Equivalent to &lt;RET&gt; followed by &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>newline-and-indent</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;LINEFEED&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>This key, if the keyboard has it, is another way to enter <kbd>C-j</kbd>. 
</dl>

   <p>The basic indentation command is &lt;TAB&gt;, which gives the current line
the correct indentation as determined from the previous lines.  The
function that &lt;TAB&gt; runs depends on the major mode; it is
<code>indent-for-tab-command</code>
in Lisp mode, <code>c-indent-command</code> in C mode, etc.  These functions
understand the syntax and conventions of different languages, but they all do
conceptually the same job: &lt;TAB&gt; in any programming-language major mode
inserts or deletes whitespace at the beginning of the current line,
independent of where point is in the line.  If point was inside the
whitespace at the beginning of the line, &lt;TAB&gt; puts it at the end of
that whitespace; otherwise, &lt;TAB&gt; keeps point fixed with respect to
the characters around it.

   <p>Use <kbd>C-q &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to insert a tab at point.

   <p>When entering lines of new code, use <kbd>C-j</kbd>
(<code>newline-and-indent</code>), which is equivalent to a &lt;RET&gt;
followed by a &lt;TAB&gt;.  <kbd>C-j</kbd> at the end of a line creates a
blank line and then gives it the appropriate indentation.

   <p>&lt;TAB&gt; indents lines that start within a parenthetical grouping
each under the preceding line (or the text after the parenthesis). 
Therefore, if you manually give one of these lines a nonstandard
indentation, the lines below will tend to follow it.  This behavior is
convenient in cases where you have overridden the standard result of
&lt;TAB&gt; because you find it unaesthetic for a particular line.

   <p>Remember that an open-parenthesis, open-brace or other opening delimiter
at the left margin is assumed by Emacs (including the indentation routines)
to be the start of a function.  Therefore, you must never have an opening
delimiter in column zero that is not the beginning of a function, not even
inside a string.  This restriction is vital for making the indentation
commands fast; you must simply accept it.  See <a href="Left-Margin-Paren.html#Left%20Margin%20Paren">Left Margin Paren</a>,
for more information on this.

   <p>Normally, lines are indented with tabs and spaces.  If you want Emacs
to use spaces only, see <a href="Just-Spaces.html#Just%20Spaces">Just Spaces</a>.
