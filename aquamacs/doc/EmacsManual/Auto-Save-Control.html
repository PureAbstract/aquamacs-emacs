<h3 class="subsection">Controlling Auto-Saving</h4>

<p>Each time you visit a file, auto-saving is turned on for that file's
buffer if the variable <code>auto-save-default</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (but not
in batch mode; see <a href="Entering-Emacs.html#Entering%20Emacs">Entering Emacs</a>).  The default for this variable is
<code>t</code>, so auto-saving is the usual practice for file-visiting buffers. 
Auto-saving can be turned on or off for any existing buffer with the
command <kbd>M-x auto-save-mode</kbd>.  Like other minor mode commands, <kbd>M-x
auto-save-mode</kbd> turns auto-saving on with a positive argument, off with a
zero or negative argument; with no argument, it toggles.

   <p>Emacs does auto-saving periodically based on counting how many characters
you have typed since the last time auto-saving was done.  The variable
<code>auto-save-interval</code> specifies how many characters there are between
auto-saves.  By default, it is 300.

   <p>Auto-saving also takes place when you stop typing for a while.  The
variable <code>auto-save-timeout</code> says how many seconds Emacs should
wait before it does an auto save (and perhaps also a garbage
collection).  (The actual time period is longer if the current buffer is
long; this is a heuristic which aims to keep out of your way when you
are editing long buffers, in which auto-save takes an appreciable amount
of time.)  Auto-saving during idle periods accomplishes two things:
first, it makes sure all your work is saved if you go away from the
terminal for a while; second, it may avoid some auto-saving while you
are actually typing.

   <p>Emacs also does auto-saving whenever it gets a fatal error.  This
includes killing the Emacs job with a shell command such as <code>kill
%emacs</code>, or disconnecting a phone line or network connection.

   <p>You can request an auto-save explicitly with the command <kbd>M-x
do-auto-save</kbd>.
