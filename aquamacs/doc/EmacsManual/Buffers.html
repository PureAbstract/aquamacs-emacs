<h2 class="chapter">23 Using Multiple Buffers</h2>

<p><a name="index-buffers-1045"></a>  The text you are editing in Emacs resides in an object called a
<dfn>buffer</dfn>.  Each time you visit a file, a buffer is created to hold the
file's text.  Each time you invoke Dired, a buffer is created to hold the
directory listing.  If you send a message with <kbd>C-x m</kbd>, a buffer named
`<samp><span class="samp">*mail*</span></samp>' is used to hold the text of the message.  When you ask for a
command's documentation, that appears in a buffer called `<samp><span class="samp">*Help*</span></samp>'.

   <p>Each buffer has a unique name, which can be of any length.  When a
buffer is displayed in a window, its name is shown in the mode line
(see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).  The distinction between upper and lower case
matters in buffer names.  Most buffers are made by visiting files, and
their names are derived from the files' names; however, you can also
create an empty buffer with any name you want.  A newly started Emacs
has a buffer named `<samp><span class="samp">*scratch*</span></samp>', which is not associated with any
file and can be used for evaluating Lisp expressions in Emacs
(see <a href="Lisp-Interaction.html#Lisp-Interaction">Lisp Interaction</a>).

   <p><a name="index-selected-buffer-1046"></a><a name="index-current-buffer-1047"></a>  At any time, one and only one buffer is <dfn>current</dfn>.  This is also
called the <dfn>selected buffer</dfn>.  We often say that a command
operates on &ldquo;the buffer&rdquo;; this really means that the command
operates on the current buffer (most commands do).  When there is only
one Emacs window, the buffer displayed in that window is current. 
When there are multiple windows present, the buffer displayed in the
<dfn>selected window</dfn> is current.  See <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p>Each buffer records individually what file it is visiting (if any),
whether it is modified, and what major mode and minor modes are in
effect (see <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).  Any Emacs variable can be made
<dfn>local to</dfn> a particular buffer, meaning its value in that buffer
can be different from the value in other buffers.  See <a href="Locals.html#Locals">Locals</a>.

   <p><a name="index-buffer-size_002c-maximum-1048"></a>  A buffer's size cannot be larger than some maximum, which is defined
by the largest buffer position representable by the <dfn>Emacs integer</dfn>
data type.  This is because Emacs tracks buffer positions using that
data type.  For 32-bit machines, the largest buffer size is 256
megabytes.
