<p><kbd>C-h i</kbd> (<code>info</code>) runs the Info program, which is used for
browsing through structured documentation files.  The entire Emacs manual
is available within Info.  Eventually all the documentation of the GNU
system will be available.  Type <kbd>h</kbd> after entering Info to run
a tutorial on using Info.

   <p>If you specify a numeric argument, <kbd>C-h i</kbd> prompts for the name of
a documentation file.  This way, you can browse a file which doesn't
have an entry in the top-level Info menu.  It is also handy when you
need to get to the documentation quickly, and you know the exact name of
the file.

   <p>There are two special help commands for accessing Emacs documentation
through Info.  <kbd>C-h C-f </kbd><var>function</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> enters Info and
goes straight to the documentation of the Emacs function
<var>function</var>.  <kbd>C-h C-k </kbd><var>key</var><kbd></kbd> enters Info and goes straight
to the documentation of the key <var>key</var>.  These two keys run the
commands <code>Info-goto-emacs-command-node</code> and
<code>Info-goto-emacs-key-command-node</code>.  You can use <kbd>C-h C-k</kbd> to
find the documentation of a menu item: just select that menu item when
<kbd>C-h C-k</kbd> prompts for a key.

   <p><kbd>C-h C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-h C-k</kbd> know about commands and keys
described in manuals other than the Emacs manual.  Thus, they make it
easier to find the documentation of commands and keys when you are not
sure which manual describes them, like when using some specialized
mode.

   <p>When editing a program, if you have an Info version of the manual for
the programming language, you can use the command <kbd>C-h C-i</kbd> to refer
to the manual documentation for a symbol (keyword, function or
variable).  The details of how this command works depend on the major
mode.

   <p>If something surprising happens, and you are not sure what commands you
typed, use <kbd>C-h l</kbd> (<code>view-lossage</code>).  <kbd>C-h l</kbd> displays the last
100 command characters you typed in.  If you see commands that you don't
know, you can use <kbd>C-h c</kbd> to find out what they do.

   <p>Emacs has numerous major modes, each of which redefines a few keys and
makes a few other changes in how editing works.  <kbd>C-h m</kbd>
(<code>describe-mode</code>) displays documentation on the current major mode,
which normally describes all the commands that are changed in this
mode.

   <p><kbd>C-h b</kbd> (<code>describe-bindings</code>) and <kbd>C-h s</kbd>
(<code>describe-syntax</code>) present other information about the current
Emacs mode.  <kbd>C-h b</kbd> displays a list of all the key bindings now in
effect, showing the local bindings defined by the current minor modes first,
then the local bindings defined by the current major mode, and finally
the global bindings (see <a href="Key-Bindings.html#Key%20Bindings">Key Bindings</a>).  <kbd>C-h s</kbd> displays the
contents of the syntax table, with explanations of each character's
syntax (see <a href="Syntax.html#Syntax">Syntax</a>).

   <p>You can get a similar list for a particular prefix key by typing
<kbd>C-h</kbd> after the prefix key.  (There are a few prefix keys for which
this does not work--those that provide their own bindings for
<kbd>C-h</kbd>.  One of these is &lt;ESC&gt;, because <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; C-h</kbd> is
actually <kbd>C-M-h</kbd>, which marks a defun.)

   <p>The other <kbd>C-h</kbd> options display various files containing useful
information.  <kbd>C-h C-w</kbd> displays the full details on the complete
absence of warranty for GNU Emacs.  <kbd>C-h n</kbd> (<code>view-emacs-news</code>)
displays the file <code>emacs/etc/NEWS</code>, which contains documentation on
Emacs changes arranged chronologically.  <kbd>C-h F</kbd>
(<code>view-emacs-FAQ</code>) displays the Emacs frequently-answered-questions
list.  <kbd>C-h t</kbd> (<code>help-with-tutorial</code>) displays the
learn-by-doing Emacs tutorial.  <kbd>C-h C-c</kbd> (<code>describe-copying</code>)
displays the file <code>emacs/etc/COPYING</code>, which tells you the
conditions you must obey in distributing copies of Emacs.  <kbd>C-h C-d</kbd>
(<code>describe-distribution</code>) displays the file
<code>emacs/etc/DISTRIB</code>, which tells you how you can order a copy of
the latest version of Emacs.  <kbd>C-h C-p</kbd> (<code>describe-project</code>)
displays general information about the GNU Project.  <kbd>C-h P</kbd>
(<code>view-emacs-problems</code>) displays the file
<code>emacs/etc/PROBLEMS</code>, which lists known problems with Emacs in
various situations with solutions or workarounds in many cases.
