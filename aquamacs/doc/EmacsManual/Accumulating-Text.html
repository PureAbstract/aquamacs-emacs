<h3 class="section">Accumulating Text</h3>

<p>Usually we copy or move text by killing it and yanking it, but there
are other methods convenient for copying one block of text in many
places, or for copying many scattered blocks of text into one place.  To
copy one block to many places, store it in a register
(see <a href="Registers.html#Registers">Registers</a>).  Here we describe the commands to accumulate
scattered pieces of text into a buffer or into a file.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x append-to-buffer</kbd>
     <dd>Append region to the contents of a specified buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x prepend-to-buffer</kbd>
     <dd>Prepend region to the contents of a specified buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x copy-to-buffer</kbd>
     <dd>Copy region into a specified buffer, deleting that buffer's old contents. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x insert-buffer</kbd>
     <dd>Insert the contents of a specified buffer into current buffer at point. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x append-to-file</kbd>
     <dd>Append region to the contents of a specified file, at the end. 
</dl>

   <p>To accumulate text into a buffer, use <kbd>M-x append-to-buffer</kbd>. 
This reads a buffer name, then inserts a copy of the region into the
buffer specified.  If you specify a nonexistent buffer,
<code>append-to-buffer</code> creates the buffer.  The text is inserted
wherever point is in that buffer.  If you have been using the buffer for
editing, the copied text goes into the middle of the text of the buffer,
starting from wherever point happens to be at that moment.

   <p>Point in that buffer is left at the end of the copied text, so
successive uses of <code>append-to-buffer</code> accumulate the text in the
specified buffer in the same order as they were copied.  Strictly
speaking, <code>append-to-buffer</code> does not always append to the text
already in the buffer--it appends only if point in that buffer is at the end. 
However, if <code>append-to-buffer</code> is the only command you use to alter
a buffer, then point is always at the end.

   <p><kbd>M-x prepend-to-buffer</kbd> is just like <code>append-to-buffer</code>
except that point in the other buffer is left before the copied text, so
successive prependings add text in reverse order.  <kbd>M-x
copy-to-buffer</kbd> is similar, except that any existing text in the other
buffer is deleted, so the buffer is left containing just the text newly
copied into it.

   <p>To retrieve the accumulated text from another buffer, use the
command <kbd>M-x insert-buffer</kbd>; this too takes <var>buffername</var> as an
argument.  It inserts a copy of the whole text in buffer
<var>buffername</var> into the current buffer at point, and sets the mark
after the inserted text.  Alternatively, you can select the other
buffer for editing, then copy text from it by killing. 
See <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>, for background information on buffers.

   <p>Instead of accumulating text within Emacs, in a buffer, you can append
text directly into a file with <kbd>M-x append-to-file</kbd>, which takes
<var>filename</var> as an argument.  It adds the text of the region to the end
of the specified file.  The file is changed immediately on disk.

   <p>You should use <code>append-to-file</code> only with files that are
<em>not</em> being visited in Emacs.  Using it on a file that you are
editing in Emacs would change the file behind Emacs's back, which
can lead to losing some of your editing.
