<h3 class="section">Inserting Text</h3>

<p>To insert printing characters into the text you are editing, just type
them.  This inserts the characters you type into the buffer at the
cursor (that is, at <dfn>point</dfn>; see <a href="Point.html#Point">Point</a>).  The cursor moves
forward, and any text after the cursor moves forward too.  If the text
in the buffer is <code>FOOBAR</code>, with the cursor before the <code>B</code>,
then if you type <kbd>XX</kbd>, you get <code>FOOXXBAR</code>, with the cursor
still before the <code>B</code>.

   <p>To <dfn>delete</dfn> text you have just inserted, use the large key
labeled &lt;DEL&gt;, &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; or &lt;DELETE&gt; which is a short
distance above the &lt;RET&gt; or &lt;ENTER&gt; key.  This is the key you
normally use, outside Emacs, for erasing the last character that you
typed.  Regardless of the label on that key, Emacs thinks of it as
&lt;DEL&gt;, and that's what we call it in this manual.

   <p>The &lt;DEL&gt; key deletes the character <em>before</em> the cursor. 
As a consequence, the cursor and all the characters after it move
backwards.  If you type a printing character and then type &lt;DEL&gt;,
they cancel out.

   <p>On most computers, Emacs recognizes automatically which key ought to
be &lt;DEL&gt;, and sets it up that way.  But in some cases, especially
with text-only terminals, you will need to tell Emacs which key to use
for that purpose.  If the large key not far above the &lt;RET&gt; or
&lt;ENTER&gt; key doesn't delete backwards, you need to do this. 
See <a href="DEL-Does-Not-Delete.html#DEL%20Does%20Not%20Delete">DEL Does Not Delete</a>, for an explanation of how.

   <p>Most PC keyboards have both a &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key a short ways above
&lt;RET&gt; or &lt;ENTER&gt;, and a &lt;DELETE&gt; key elsewhere.  On these
keyboards, Emacs supports when possible the usual convention that the
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key deletes backwards (it is &lt;DEL&gt;), while the
&lt;DELETE&gt; key deletes "forwards," deleting the character after
point, the one underneath the cursor, like <kbd>C-d</kbd> (see below).

   <p>To end a line and start typing a new one, type &lt;RET&gt;.  This
inserts a newline character in the buffer.  If point is in the middle of
a line, &lt;RET&gt; splits the line.  Typing &lt;DEL&gt; when the cursor is
at the beginning of a line deletes the preceding newline, thus joining
the line with the preceding line.

   <p>Emacs can split lines automatically when they become too long, if you
turn on a special minor mode called <dfn>Auto Fill</dfn> mode. 
See <a href="Filling.html#Filling">Filling</a>, for how to use Auto Fill mode.

   <p>If you prefer to have text characters replace (overwrite) existing
text rather than shove it to the right, you can enable Overwrite mode,
a minor mode.  See <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor%20Modes">Minor Modes</a>.

   <p>Direct insertion works for printing characters and &lt;SPC&gt;, but other
characters act as editing commands and do not insert themselves.  If you
need to insert a control character or a character whose code is above 200
octal, you must <dfn>quote</dfn> it by typing the character <kbd>Control-q</kbd>
(<code>quoted-insert</code>) first.  (This character's name is normally written
<kbd>C-q</kbd> for short.)  There are two ways to use <kbd>C-q</kbd>:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-q</kbd> followed by any non-graphic character (even <kbd>C-g</kbd>)
inserts that character.

     <li><kbd>C-q</kbd> followed by a sequence of octal digits inserts the character
with the specified octal character code.  You can use any number of
octal digits; any non-digit terminates the sequence.  If the
terminating character is &lt;RET&gt;, it serves only to terminate the
sequence.  Any other non-digit terminates the sequence and then acts
as normal input--thus, <kbd>C-q 1 0 1 B</kbd> inserts <code>AB</code>.

     <p>The use of octal sequences is disabled in ordinary non-binary
Overwrite mode, to give you a convenient way to insert a digit instead
of overwriting with it. 
</ul>

<p>When multibyte characters are enabled, if you specify a code in the
range 0200 through 0377 octal, <kbd>C-q</kbd> assumes that you intend to
use some ISO 8859-<var>n</var> character set, and converts the specified
code to the corresponding Emacs character code.  See <a href="Enabling-Multibyte.html#Enabling%20Multibyte">Enabling Multibyte</a>.  You select <em>which</em> of the ISO 8859 character sets to
use through your choice of language environment (see <a href="Language-Environments.html#Language%20Environments">Language Environments</a>).

   <p>To use decimal or hexadecimal instead of octal, set the variable
<code>read-quoted-char-radix</code> to 10 or 16.  If the radix is greater than
10, some letters starting with <kbd>a</kbd> serve as part of a character
code, just like digits.

   <p>A numeric argument to <kbd>C-q</kbd> specifies how many copies of the
quoted character should be inserted (see <a href="Arguments.html#Arguments">Arguments</a>).

   <p>Customization information: &lt;DEL&gt; in most modes runs the command
<code>delete-backward-char</code>; &lt;RET&gt; runs the command <code>newline</code>, and
self-inserting printing characters run the command <code>self-insert</code>,
which inserts whatever character was typed to invoke it.  Some major modes
rebind &lt;DEL&gt; to other commands.
