<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.3.1 Basic Version Control with Merging</h5>

<p>When your version control system is merging-based (the default for
CVS and all newer version control systems), work files are always
writable; you need not do anything special to begin editing a file. 
The status indicator on the mode line is `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' if the file is
unmodified; it flips to `<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' as soon as you save any changes
(see <a href="VC-Mode-Line.html#VC-Mode-Line">VC Mode Line</a>).

   <p>Here is what <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> does when using a merging-based system:

     <ul>
<li>If the work file is the same as in the repository, it does nothing.

     <li>If you have not changed the work file, but some other user has checked
in changes to the repository, <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> merges those changes into
the work file.

     <li>If you have made modifications to the work file, <kbd>C-x v v</kbd>
attempts to check in your changes.  To do this, Emacs first reads the
log entry for the new revision (see <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).  If some other
user has checked in changes to the repository since you last checked
it out, the checkin fails.  In that case, type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> again to
merge those changes into your own work file; this puts the work file
into a &ldquo;conflicted&rdquo; state.  Type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> to clear the
&ldquo;conflicted&rdquo; state; VC then regards the file as up-to-date and
modified, and you can try to check it in again.

     <p>To pick up any recent changes from the repository <em>without</em>
trying to commit your own changes, type <kbd>C-x v m &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
See <a href="Merging.html#Merging">Merging</a>. 
</ul>

   <p>These rules also apply when you use RCS in its &ldquo;non-locking&rdquo; mode,
except that changes will not be automatically merged from the
repository.  Nothing informs you if another user has checked in
changes in the same file since you began editing it; when you check in
your revision, his changes are removed (however, they remain in the
repository and are thus not irrevocably lost).  Therefore, you must
verify that the current revision is unchanged before checking in your
changes.  In addition, locking is possible with RCS even in this mode:
<kbd>C-x v v</kbd> with an unmodified file locks the file, just as it does
with RCS in its normal locking mode (see <a href="VC-With-A-Locking-VCS.html#VC-With-A-Locking-VCS">VC With A Locking VCS</a>).
