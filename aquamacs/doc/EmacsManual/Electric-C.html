<h3 class="subsection">Electric C Characters</h4>

<p>In C mode and related modes, certain printing characters are
"electric"--in addition to inserting themselves, they also reindent
the current line and may insert newlines.  This feature is controlled by
the variable <code>c-auto-newline</code>.  The "electric" characters are
<kbd>{</kbd>, <kbd>}</kbd>, <kbd>:</kbd>, <kbd>#</kbd>, <kbd>;</kbd>, <kbd>,</kbd>, <kbd>&lt;</kbd>,
<kbd>&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>/</kbd>, <kbd>*</kbd>, <kbd>(</kbd>, and <kbd>)</kbd>.

   <p>Electric characters insert newlines only when the <dfn>auto-newline</dfn>
feature is enabled (indicated by <code>/a</code> in the mode line after the
mode name).  This feature is controlled by the variable
<code>c-auto-newline</code>.  You can turn this feature on or off with the
command <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>
     <dd>Toggle the auto-newline feature (<code>c-toggle-auto-state</code>).  With a
prefix argument, this command turns the auto-newline feature on if the
argument is positive, and off if it is negative. 
</dl>

   <p>The colon character is electric because that is appropriate for a
single colon.  But when you want to insert a double colon in C++, the
electric behavior of colon is inconvenient.  You can insert a double
colon with no reindentation or newlines by typing <kbd>C-c :</kbd>:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-c :</kbd>
     <dd>Insert a double colon scope operator at point, without reindenting the
line or adding any newlines (<code>c-scope-operator</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The electric <kbd>#</kbd> key reindents the line if it appears to be the
beginning of a preprocessor directive.  This happens when the value of
<code>c-electric-pound-behavior</code> is <code>(alignleft)</code>.  You can turn
this feature off by setting <code>c-electric-pound-behavior</code> to
<code>nil</code>.

   <p>The variable <code>c-hanging-braces-alist</code> controls the insertion of
newlines before and after inserted braces.  It is an association list
with elements of the following form: <code>(</code><var>syntactic-symbol</var><code>
. </code><var>nl-list</var><code>)</code>.  Most of the syntactic symbols that appear in
<code>c-offsets-alist</code> are meaningful here as well.

   <p>The list <var>nl-list</var> may contain either of the symbols
<code>before</code> or <code>after</code>, or both; or it may be <code>nil</code>.  When a
brace is inserted, the syntactic context it defines is looked up in
<code>c-hanging-braces-alist</code>; if it is found, the <var>nl-list</var> is used
to determine where newlines are inserted: either before the brace,
after, or both.  If not found, the default is to insert a newline both
before and after braces.

   <p>The variable <code>c-hanging-colons-alist</code> controls the insertion of
newlines before and after inserted colons.  It is an association list
with elements of the following form: <code>(</code><var>syntactic-symbol</var><code>
. </code><var>nl-list</var><code>)</code>.  The list <var>nl-list</var> may contain either of the
symbols <code>before</code> or <code>after</code>, or both; or it may be <code>nil</code>.

   <p>When a colon is inserted, the syntactic symbol it defines is looked
up in this list, and if found, the <var>nl-list</var> is used to determine
where newlines are inserted: either before the brace, after, or both. 
If the syntactic symbol is not found in this list, no newlines are
inserted.

   <p>Electric characters can also delete newlines automatically when the
auto-newline feature is enabled.  This feature makes auto-newline more
acceptable, by deleting the newlines in the most common cases where you
do not want them.  Emacs can recognize several cases in which deleting a
newline might be desirable; by setting the variable
<code>c-cleanup-list</code>, you can specify <em>which</em> of these cases that
should happen.  The variable's value is a list of symbols, each
describing one case for possible deletion of a newline.  Here are the
meaningful symbols, and their meanings:

     <dl>
<dt><code>brace-catch-brace</code>
     <dd>Clean up <code>} catch (</code><var>condition</var><code>) {</code> constructs by placing the
entire construct on a single line.  The clean-up occurs when you type
the <code>{</code>, if there is nothing between the braces aside from
<code>catch</code> and <var>condition</var>.

     <br><dt><code>brace-else-brace</code>
     <dd>Clean up <code>} else {</code> constructs by placing the entire construct on
a single line.  The clean-up occurs when you type the <code>{</code> after
the <code>else</code>, but only if there is nothing but white space between
the braces and the <code>else</code>.

     <br><dt><code>brace-elseif-brace</code>
     <dd>Clean up <code>} else if (...) {</code> constructs by placing the entire
construct on a single line.  The clean-up occurs when you type the
<code>{</code>, if there is nothing but white space between the <code>}</code> and
<code>{</code> aside from the keywords and the <code>if</code>-condition.

     <br><dt><code>empty-defun-braces</code>
     <dd>Clean up empty defun braces by placing the braces on the same
line.  Clean-up occurs when you type the closing brace.

     <br><dt><code>defun-close-semi</code>
     <dd>Clean up the semicolon after a <code>struct</code> or similar type
declaration, by placing the semicolon on the same line as the closing
brace.  Clean-up occurs when you type the semicolon.

     <br><dt><code>list-close-comma</code>
     <dd>Clean up commas following braces in array and aggregate
initializers.  Clean-up occurs when you type the comma.

     <br><dt><code>scope-operator</code>
     <dd>Clean up double colons which may designate a C++ scope operator, by
placing the colons together.  Clean-up occurs when you type the second
colon, but only when the two colons are separated by nothing but
whitespace.
