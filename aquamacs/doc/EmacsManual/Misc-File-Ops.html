<h3 class="section">Miscellaneous File Operations</h3>

<p>Emacs has commands for performing many other operations on files. 
All operate on one file; they do not accept wildcard file names.

   <p><kbd>M-x view-file</kbd> allows you to scan or read a file by sequential
screenfuls.  It reads a file name argument using the minibuffer.  After
reading the file into an Emacs buffer, <code>view-file</code> displays the
beginning.  You can then type &lt;SPC&gt; to scroll forward one windowful,
or &lt;DEL&gt; to scroll backward.  Various other commands are provided
for moving around in the file, but none for changing it; type <kbd>?</kbd>
while viewing for a list of them.  They are mostly the same as normal
Emacs cursor motion commands.  To exit from viewing, type <kbd>q</kbd>. 
The commands for viewing are defined by a special major mode called View
mode.

   <p>A related command, <kbd>M-x view-buffer</kbd>, views a buffer already present
in Emacs.  See <a href="Misc-Buffer.html#Misc%20Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.

   <p><kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd> (also <kbd>C-x i</kbd>) inserts a copy of the
contents of the specified file into the current buffer at point,
leaving point unchanged before the contents and the mark after them.

   <p><kbd>M-x write-region</kbd> is the inverse of <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd>; it
copies the contents of the region into the specified file.  <kbd>M-x
append-to-file</kbd> adds the text of the region to the end of the specified
file.  See <a href="Accumulating-Text.html#Accumulating%20Text">Accumulating Text</a>.

   <p><kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> deletes the specified file, like the <code>rm</code>
command in the shell.  If you are deleting many files in one directory, it
may be more convenient to use Dired (see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).

   <p><kbd>M-x rename-file</kbd> reads two file names <var>old</var> and <var>new</var> using
the minibuffer, then renames file <var>old</var> as <var>new</var>.  If the file name
<var>new</var> already exists, you must confirm with <kbd>yes</kbd> or renaming is not
done; this is because renaming causes the old meaning of the name <var>new</var>
to be lost.  If <var>old</var> and <var>new</var> are on different file systems, the
file <var>old</var> is copied and deleted.

   <p>The similar command <kbd>M-x add-name-to-file</kbd> is used to add an
additional name to an existing file without removing its old name. 
The new name is created as a "hard link" to the existing file. 
The new name must belong on the same file system that the file is on. 
On Windows, this command works only if the file resides in an NTFS
file system.  On MS-DOS, it works by copying the file.

   <p><kbd>M-x copy-file</kbd> reads the file <var>old</var> and writes a new file named
<var>new</var> with the same contents.  Confirmation is required if a file named
<var>new</var> already exists, because copying has the consequence of overwriting
the old contents of the file <var>new</var>.

   <p><kbd>M-x make-symbolic-link</kbd> reads two file names <var>target</var> and
<var>linkname</var>, then creates a symbolic link named <var>linkname</var>, which
points at <var>target</var>.  The effect is that future attempts to open file
<var>linkname</var> will refer to whatever file is named <var>target</var> at the
time the opening is done, or will get an error if the name <var>target</var> is
not in use at that time.  This command does not expand the argument
<var>target</var>, so that it allows you to specify a relative name
as the target of the link.

   <p>Confirmation is required when creating the link if <var>linkname</var> is
in use.  Note that not all systems support symbolic links; on systems
that don't support them, this command is not defined.
