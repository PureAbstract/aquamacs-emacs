<h3 class="section">Basic Editing in Picture Mode</h3>

<p>Most keys do the same thing in Picture mode that they usually do, but
do it in a quarter-plane style.  For example, <kbd>C-f</kbd> is rebound to
run <code>picture-forward-column</code>, a command which moves point one
column to the right, inserting a space if necessary so that the actual
end of the line makes no difference.  <kbd>C-b</kbd> is rebound to run
<code>picture-backward-column</code>, which always moves point left one
column, converting a tab to multiple spaces if necessary.  <kbd>C-n</kbd> and
<kbd>C-p</kbd> are rebound to run <code>picture-move-down</code> and
<code>picture-move-up</code>, which can either insert spaces or convert tabs
as necessary to make sure that point stays in exactly the same column. 
<kbd>C-e</kbd> runs <code>picture-end-of-line</code>, which moves to after the last
nonblank character on the line.  There is no need to change <kbd>C-a</kbd>,
as the choice of screen model does not affect beginnings of
lines.

   <p>Insertion of text is adapted to the quarter-plane screen model through
the use of Overwrite mode (see <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor%20Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  Self-inserting characters
replace existing text, column by column, rather than pushing existing text
to the right.  &lt;RET&gt; runs <code>picture-newline</code>, which just moves to
the beginning of the following line so that new text will replace that
line.

   <p>Picture mode provides erasure instead of deletion and killing of
text.  &lt;DEL&gt; (<code>picture-backward-clear-column</code>) replaces the
preceding character with a space rather than removing it; this moves
point backwards.  <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>picture-clear-column</code>) replaces the
next character or characters with spaces, but does not move point.  (If
you want to clear characters to spaces and move forward over them, use
&lt;SPC&gt;.)  <kbd>C-k</kbd> (<code>picture-clear-line</code>) really kills the
contents of lines, but does not delete the newlines from the
buffer.

   <p>To do actual insertion, you must use special commands.  <kbd>C-o</kbd>
(<code>picture-open-line</code>) creates a blank line after the current line;
it never splits a line.  <kbd>C-M-o</kbd> (<code>split-line</code>) makes sense in
Picture mode, so it is not changed.  <kbd>C-j</kbd>
(<code>picture-duplicate-line</code>) inserts below the current line another
line with the same contents.

   <p>To do actual deletion in Picture mode, use <kbd>C-w</kbd>, <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>
(which is defined as <code>delete-char</code>, as <kbd>C-d</kbd> is in other
modes), or one of the picture rectangle commands (see <a href="Rectangles-in-Picture.html#Rectangles%20in%20Picture">Rectangles in Picture</a>).
