<h3 class="section">Holidays</h3>

<p>The Emacs calendar knows about all major and many minor holidays,
and can display them.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>h</kbd>
     <dd>Display holidays for the selected date
(<code>calendar-cursor-holidays</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-2 Holidays</kbd>
     <dd>Display any holidays for the date you click on. 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd>
     <dd>Mark holidays in the calendar window (<code>mark-calendar-holidays</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd>
     <dd>Unmark calendar window (<code>calendar-unmark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>a</kbd>
     <dd>List all holidays for the displayed three months in another window
(<code>list-calendar-holidays</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x holidays</kbd>
     <dd>List all holidays for three months around today's date in another
window. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x list-holidays</kbd>
     <dd>List holidays in another window for a specified range of years. 
</dl>

   <p>To see if any holidays fall on a given date, position point on that
date in the calendar window and use the <kbd>h</kbd> command.  Alternatively,
click on that date with <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> and then choose <kbd>Holidays</kbd>
from the menu that appears.  Either way, this displays the holidays for
that date, in the echo area if they fit there, otherwise in a separate
window.

   <p>To view the distribution of holidays for all the dates shown in the
calendar, use the <kbd>x</kbd> command.  This displays the dates that are
holidays in a different face (or places a <code>*</code> after these dates, if
display with multiple faces is not available).  The command applies both
to the currently visible months and to other months that subsequently
become visible by scrolling.  To turn marking off and erase the current
marks, type <kbd>u</kbd>, which also erases any diary marks (see <a href="Diary.html#Diary">Diary</a>).

   <p>To get even more detailed information, use the <kbd>a</kbd> command, which
displays a separate buffer containing a list of all holidays in the
current three-month range.  You can use &lt;SPC&gt; in the calendar window
to scroll that list.

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x holidays</kbd> displays the list of holidays for the
current month and the preceding and succeeding months; this works even
if you don't have a calendar window.  If you want the list of holidays
centered around a different month, use <kbd>C-u M-x holidays</kbd>, which
prompts for the month and year.

   <p>The holidays known to Emacs include United States holidays and the
major Christian, Jewish, and Islamic holidays; also the solstices and
equinoxes.

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x list-holidays</kbd> displays the list of holidays for
a range of years.  This function asks you for the starting and stopping
years, and allows you to choose all the holidays or one of several
categories of holidays.  You can use this command even if you don't have
a calendar window.

   <p>The dates used by Emacs for holidays are based on <em>current
practice</em>, not historical fact.  Historically, for instance, the start
of daylight savings time and even its existence have varied from year to
year, but present United States law mandates that daylight savings time
begins on the first Sunday in April.  When the daylight savings rules
are set up for the United States, Emacs always uses the present
definition, even though it is wrong for some prior years.
