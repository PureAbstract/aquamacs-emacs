<h3 class="section">Text Mode</h3>

<p>When you edit files of text in a human language, it's more convenient
to use Text mode rather than Fundamental mode.  To enter Text mode, type
<kbd>M-x text-mode</kbd>.

   <p>In Text mode, only blank lines and page delimiters separate
paragraphs.  As a result, paragraphs can be indented, and adaptive
filling determines what indentation to use when filling a paragraph. 
See <a href="Adaptive-Fill.html#Adaptive%20Fill">Adaptive Fill</a>.

   <p>Text mode defines &lt;TAB&gt; to run <code>indent-relative</code>
(see <a href="Indentation.html#Indentation">Indentation</a>), so that you can conveniently indent a line like
the previous line.  When the previous line is not indented,
<code>indent-relative</code> runs <code>tab-to-tab-stop</code>, which uses Emacs tab
stops that you can set (see <a href="Tab-Stops.html#Tab%20Stops">Tab Stops</a>).

   <p>Text mode turns off the features concerned with comments except when
you explicitly invoke them.  It changes the syntax table so that periods
are not considered part of a word, while apostrophes, backspaces and
underlines are considered part of words.

   <p>If you indent the first lines of paragraphs, then you should use
Paragraph-Indent Text mode rather than Text mode.  In this mode, you do
not need to have blank lines between paragraphs, because the first-line
indentation is sufficient to start a paragraph; however paragraphs in
which every line is indented are not supported.  Use <kbd>M-x
paragraph-indent-text-mode</kbd> to enter this mode.  Use <kbd>M-x
paragraph-indent-minor-mode</kbd> to enter an equivalent minor mode, for
instance during mail composition.

   <p>Text mode, and all the modes based on it, define <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> as
the command <code>ispell-complete-word</code>, which performs completion of
the partial word in the buffer before point, using the spelling
dictionary as the space of possible words.  See <a href="Spelling.html#Spelling">Spelling</a>.

   <p>Entering Text mode runs the hook <code>text-mode-hook</code>.  Other major
modes related to Text mode also run this hook, followed by hooks of
their own; this includes Paragraph-Indent Text mode, Nroff mode, TeX
mode, Outline mode, and Mail mode.  Hook functions on
<code>text-mode-hook</code> can look at the value of <code>major-mode</code> to see
which of these modes is actually being entered.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.
