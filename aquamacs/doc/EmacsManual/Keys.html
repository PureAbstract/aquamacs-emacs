<p>A <dfn>key sequence</dfn> (<dfn>key</dfn>, for short) is a sequence of input
events that are meaningful as a unit--as "a single command."  Some
Emacs command sequences are just one character or one event; for
example, just <kbd>C-f</kbd> is enough to move forward one character in the
buffer.  But Emacs also has commands that take two or more events to
invoke.

   <p>If a sequence of events is enough to invoke a command, it is a
<dfn>complete key</dfn>.  Examples of complete keys include <kbd>C-a</kbd>,
<kbd>X</kbd>, &lt;RET&gt;, &lt;NEXT&gt; (a function key), &lt;DOWN&gt; (an arrow
key), <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, and <kbd>C-x 4 C-f</kbd>.  If it isn't long enough to be
complete, we call it a <dfn>prefix key</dfn>.  The above examples show that
<kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 4</kbd> are prefix keys.  Every key sequence is either
a complete key or a prefix key.

   <p>Most single characters constitute complete keys in the standard Emacs
command bindings.  A few of them are prefix keys.  A prefix key combines
with the following input event to make a longer key sequence, which may
itself be complete or a prefix.  For example, <kbd>C-x</kbd> is a prefix key,
so <kbd>C-x</kbd> and the next input event combine to make a two-event
key sequence.  Most of these key sequences are complete keys, including
<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-x b</kbd>.  A few, such as <kbd>C-x 4</kbd> and <kbd>C-x
r</kbd>, are themselves prefix keys that lead to three-event key
sequences.  There's no limit to the length of a key sequence, but in
practice people rarely use sequences longer than four events.

   <p>By contrast, you can't add more events onto a complete key.  For
example, the two-event sequence <kbd>C-f C-k</kbd> is not a key, because
the <kbd>C-f</kbd> is a complete key in itself.  It's impossible to give
<kbd>C-f C-k</kbd> an independent meaning as a command.  <kbd>C-f C-k</kbd> is two
key sequences, not one.

   <p>All told, the prefix keys in Emacs are <kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-h</kbd>,
<kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>C-x @</kbd>, <kbd>C-x a</kbd>, <kbd>C-x n</kbd>, <kbd>C-x&nbsp;r</kbd>, <kbd>C-x v</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 5</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 6</kbd>, &lt;ESC&gt;, and
<kbd>M-g</kbd>.  But this list is not cast in concrete; it is
just a matter of Emacs's standard key bindings.  If you customize Emacs,
you can make new prefix keys, or eliminate these.  See <a href="Key-Bindings.html#Key%20Bindings">Key Bindings</a>.

   <p>If you do make or eliminate prefix keys, that changes the set of
possible key sequences.  For example, if you redefine <kbd>C-f</kbd> as a
prefix, <kbd>C-f C-k</kbd> automatically becomes a key (complete, unless you
define that too as a prefix).  Conversely, if you remove the prefix
definition of <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>, then <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> (or <kbd>C-x 4
</kbd><var>anything</var><kbd></kbd>) is no longer a key.

   <p>Typing the help character (<kbd>C-h</kbd> or &lt;F1&gt;) after a prefix
key displays a list of the commands starting with that prefix. 
There are a few prefix keys for which <kbd>C-h</kbd> does not
work--for historical reasons, they have other meanings for <kbd>C-h</kbd>
which are not easy to change.  But &lt;F1&gt; should work for all prefix
keys.
