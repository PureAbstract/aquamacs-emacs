<h3 class="subsection">Commands Displaying Diary Entries</h4>

<p>Once you have created a <code>~/diary</code> file, you can use the calendar
to view it.  You can also view today's events outside of Calendar mode.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd>
     <dd>Display all diary entries for the selected date
(<code>view-diary-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-2 Diary</kbd>
     <dd>Display all diary entries for the date you click on. 
<br><dt><kbd>s</kbd>
     <dd>Display the entire diary file (<code>show-all-diary-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>m</kbd>
     <dd>Mark all visible dates that have diary entries
(<code>mark-diary-entries</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd>
     <dd>Unmark the calendar window (<code>calendar-unmark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x print-diary-entries</kbd>
     <dd>Print hard copy of the diary display as it appears. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x diary</kbd>
     <dd>Display all diary entries for today's date. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x diary-mail-entries</kbd>
     <dd>Mail yourself email reminders about upcoming diary entries. 
</dl>

   <p>Displaying the diary entries with <kbd>d</kbd> shows in a separate window
the diary entries for the selected date in the calendar.  The mode line
of the new window shows the date of the diary entries and any holidays
that fall on that date.  If you specify a numeric argument with <kbd>d</kbd>,
it shows all the diary entries for that many successive days.  Thus,
<kbd>2 d</kbd> displays all the entries for the selected date and for the
following day.

   <p>Another way to display the diary entries for a date is to click
<kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> on the date, and then choose <kbd>Diary entries</kbd> from
the menu that appears.

   <p>To get a broader view of which days are mentioned in the diary, use
the <kbd>m</kbd> command.  This displays the dates that have diary entries
in a different face (or places a <code>+</code> after these dates, if
display with multiple faces is not available).  The command applies both
to the currently visible months and to other months that subsequently
become visible by scrolling.  To turn marking off and erase the current
marks, type <kbd>u</kbd>, which also turns off holiday marks
(see <a href="Holidays.html#Holidays">Holidays</a>).

   <p>To see the full diary file, rather than just some of the entries, use
the <kbd>s</kbd> command.

   <p>Display of selected diary entries uses the selective display feature
to hide entries that don't apply.

   <p>The diary buffer as you see it is an illusion, so simply printing the
buffer does not print what you see on your screen.  There is a special
command to print hard copy of the diary buffer <em>as it appears</em>;
this command is <kbd>M-x print-diary-entries</kbd>.  It sends the data
directly to the printer.  You can customize it like <code>lpr-region</code>
(see <a href="Hardcopy.html#Hardcopy">Hardcopy</a>).

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x diary</kbd> displays the diary entries for the current
date, independently of the calendar display, and optionally for the next
few days as well; the variable <code>number-of-diary-entries</code> specifies
how many days to include.  See <a href="../elisp/Calendar.html#Calendar">Customizing the Calendar and Diary</a>.

   <p>If you put <code>(diary)</code> in your <code>.emacs</code> file, this
automatically displays a window with the day's diary entries, when you
enter Emacs.  The mode line of the displayed window shows the date and
any holidays that fall on that date.

   <p>Many users like to receive notice of events in their diary as email. 
To send such mail to yourself, use the command <kbd>M-x
diary-mail-entries</kbd>.  A prefix argument specifies how many days
(starting with today) to check; otherwise, the variable
<code>diary-mail-days</code> says how many days.
