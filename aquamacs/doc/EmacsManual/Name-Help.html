<h3 class="section">Help by Command or Variable Name</h3>

<p><kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>) reads the name of a Lisp function
using the minibuffer, then displays that function's documentation string
in a window.  Since commands are Lisp functions, you can use this to get
the documentation of a command that you know by name.  For example,

<pre class="example">     C-h f auto-fill-mode &lt;RET&gt;
     </pre>

<p>displays the documentation of <code>auto-fill-mode</code>.  This is the only
way to get the documentation of a command that is not bound to any key
(one which you would normally run using <kbd>M-x</kbd>).

   <p><kbd>C-h f</kbd> is also useful for Lisp functions that you are planning to
use in a Lisp program.  For example, if you have just written the
expression <code>(make-vector len)</code> and want to check that you are using
<code>make-vector</code> properly, type <kbd>C-h f make-vector &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
Because <kbd>C-h f</kbd> allows all function names, not just command names,
you may find that some of your favorite abbreviations that work in
<kbd>M-x</kbd> don't work in <kbd>C-h f</kbd>.  An abbreviation may be unique
among command names yet fail to be unique when other function names are
allowed.

   <p>The default function name for <kbd>C-h f</kbd> to describe, if you type
just &lt;RET&gt;, is the name of the function called by the innermost Lisp
expression in the buffer around point, <em>provided</em> that is a valid,
defined Lisp function name.  For example, if point is located following
the text <code>(make-vector (car x)</code>, the innermost list containing
point is the one that starts with <code>(make-vector</code>, so the default is
to describe the function <code>make-vector</code>.

   <p><kbd>C-h f</kbd> is often useful just to verify that you have the right
spelling for the function name.  If <kbd>C-h f</kbd> mentions a name from the
buffer as the default, that name must be defined as a Lisp function.  If
that is all you want to know, just type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to cancel the <kbd>C-h
f</kbd> command, then go on editing.

   <p><kbd>C-h w </kbd><var>command</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> tells you what keys are bound to
<var>command</var>.  It displays a list of the keys in the echo area.  If it
says the command is not on any key, you must use <kbd>M-x</kbd> to run it. 
<kbd>C-h w</kbd> runs the command <code>where-is</code>.

   <p><kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>) is like <kbd>C-h f</kbd> but describes
Lisp variables instead of Lisp functions.  Its default is the Lisp symbol
around or before point, but only if that is the name of a known Lisp
variable.  See <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>.

   <p>Help buffers describing variables or functions defined in Lisp
normally have hyperlinks to the Lisp definition, if you have the Lisp
source files installed.  If you know Lisp, this provides the ultimate
documentation.  If you don't know Lisp, you should learn it.  If you
are treating Emacs as an object file, then you are just <em>using</em>
Emacs.  For real intimacy with Emacs, you must read the source code.
