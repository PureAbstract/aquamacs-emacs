<h3 class="subsection">Other Commands for C Mode</h4>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-M-h</kbd>
     <dd>Put mark at the end of a function definition, and put point at the
beginning (<code>c-mark-function</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-q</kbd>
     <dd>Fill a paragraph, handling C and C++ comments (<code>c-fill-paragraph</code>). 
If any part of the current line is a comment or within a comment, this
command fills the comment or the paragraph of it that point is in,
preserving the comment indentation and comment delimiters.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-e</kbd>
     <dd>Run the C preprocessor on the text in the region, and show the result,
which includes the expansion of all the macro calls
(<code>c-macro-expand</code>).  The buffer text before the region is also
included in preprocessing, for the sake of macros defined there, but the
output from this part isn't shown.

     <p>When you are debugging C code that uses macros, sometimes it is hard to
figure out precisely how the macros expand.  With this command, you
don't have to figure it out; you can see the expansions.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-\</kbd>
     <dd>Insert or align <code>\</code> characters at the ends of the lines of the
region (<code>c-backslash-region</code>).  This is useful after writing or
editing a C macro definition.

     <p>If a line already ends in <code>\</code>, this command adjusts the amount of
whitespace before it.  Otherwise, it inserts a new <code>\</code>.  However,
the last line in the region is treated specially; no <code>\</code> is
inserted on that line, and any <code>\</code> there is deleted.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cpp-highlight-buffer</kbd>
     <dd>Highlight parts of the text according to its preprocessor conditionals. 
This command displays another buffer named <code>*CPP Edit*</code>, which
serves as a graphic menu for selecting how to display particular kinds
of conditionals and their contents.  After changing various settings,
click on <code>[A]pply these settings</code> (or go to that buffer and type
<kbd>a</kbd>) to rehighlight the C mode buffer accordingly.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd>
     <dd>Display the syntactic information about the current source line
(<code>c-show-syntactic-information</code>).  This is the information that
directs how the line is indented.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x cwarn-mode</kbd>
     <dd><dt><kbd>M-x global-cwarn-mode</kbd>
     <dd>CWarn minor mode highlights certain suspicious C and C++ constructions:

          <ul>
<li>Assignments inside expressions. 
<li>Semicolon following immediately after <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>while</code>
(except after a <code>do ... while</code> statement);
<li>C++ functions with reference parameters. 
</ul>

     <p>You can enable the mode for one buffer with the command <kbd>M-x
cwarn-mode</kbd>, or for all suitable buffers with the command <kbd>M-x
global-cwarn-mode</kbd> or by customizing the variable
<code>global-cwarn-mode</code>.  You must also enable Font Lock mode to make
it work.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x hide-ifdef-mode</kbd>
     <dd>Hide-ifdef minor mode hides selected code within <code>#if</code> and
<code>#ifdef</code> preprocessor blocks.  See the documentation string of
<code>hide-ifdef-mode</code> for more information.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x ff-find-related-file</kbd>
     <dd>Find a file "related" in a special way to the file visited by the
current buffer.  Typically this will be the header file corresponding
to a C/C++ source file, or vice versa.  The variable
<code>ff-related-file-alist</code> specifies how to compute related file
names.
