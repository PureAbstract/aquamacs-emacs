<h3 class="section">Apropos</h3>

<p>A more sophisticated sort of question to ask is, "What are the
commands for working with files?"  To ask this question, type <kbd>C-h
a file &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, which displays a list of all command names that
contain <code>file</code>, including <code>copy-file</code>, <code>find-file</code>, and
so on.  With each command name appears a brief description of how to use
the command, and what keys you can currently invoke it with.  For
example, it would say that you can invoke <code>find-file</code> by typing
<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.  The <kbd>a</kbd> in <kbd>C-h a</kbd> stands for "Apropos";
<kbd>C-h a</kbd> runs the command <code>apropos-command</code>.  This command
normally checks only commands (interactive functions); if you specify a
prefix argument, it checks noninteractive functions as well.

   <p>Because <kbd>C-h a</kbd> looks only for functions whose names contain the
string you specify, you must use ingenuity in choosing the
string.  If you are looking for commands for killing backwards and
<kbd>C-h a kill-backwards &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> doesn't reveal any, don't give up. 
Try just <kbd>kill</kbd>, or just <kbd>backwards</kbd>, or just <kbd>back</kbd>.  Be
persistent.  Also note that you can use a regular expression as the
argument, for more flexibility (see <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>).

   <p>Here is a set of arguments to give to <kbd>C-h a</kbd> that covers many
classes of Emacs commands, since there are strong conventions for naming
the standard Emacs commands.  By giving you a feel for the naming
conventions, this set should also serve to aid you in developing a
technique for picking <code>apropos</code> strings.

   <blockquote>
char, line, word, sentence, paragraph, region, page, sexp, list, defun,
rect, buffer, frame, window, face, file, dir, register, mode, beginning, end,
forward, backward, next, previous, up, down, search, goto, kill, delete,
mark, insert, yank, fill, indent, case, change, set, what, list, find,
view, describe, default. 
</blockquote>

   <p>To list all user variables that match a regexp, use the command
<kbd>M-x apropos-variable</kbd>. This command shows only user variables and
customization options by default; if you specify a prefix argument, it
checks all variables.

   <p>To list all Lisp symbols that contain a match for a regexp, not just
the ones that are defined as commands, use the command <kbd>M-x apropos</kbd>
instead of <kbd>C-h a</kbd>.  This command does not check key bindings by
default; specify a numeric argument if you want it to check them.

   <p>The <code>apropos-documentation</code> command is like <code>apropos</code> except
that it searches documentation strings as well as symbol names for
matches for the specified regular expression.

   <p>The <code>apropos-value</code> command is like <code>apropos</code> except that it
searches symbols' values for matches for the specified regular
expression.  This command does not check function definitions or
property lists by default; specify a numeric argument if you want it to
check them.

   <p>If the variable <code>apropos-do-all</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the commands
above all behave as if they had been given a prefix argument.

   <p>If you want more information about a function definition, variable or
symbol property listed in the Apropos buffer, you can click on it with
<kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> or move there and type &lt;RET&gt;.
