<h3 class="subsection">Summary of Gnus Commands</h4>

<p>Reading news is a two-step process:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Choose a group in the group buffer.

     <li>Select articles from the summary buffer.  Each article selected is
displayed in the article buffer in a large window, below the summary
buffer in its small window.
        </ol>

   <p>Each Gnus buffer has its own special commands; however, the meanings
of any given key in the various Gnus buffers are usually analogous, even
if not identical.  Here are commands for the group and summary buffers:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>q</kbd>
     <dd>In the group buffer, update your <code>.newsrc</code> initialization file
and quit Gnus.

     <p>In the summary buffer, exit the current group and return to the
group buffer.  Thus, typing <kbd>q</kbd> twice quits Gnus.

     <br><dt><kbd>L</kbd>
     <dd>In the group buffer, list all the groups available on your news
server (except those you have killed).  This may be a long list!

     <br><dt><kbd>l</kbd>
     <dd>In the group buffer, list only the groups to which you subscribe and
which contain unread articles.

     <br><dt><kbd>u</kbd>
     <dd>In the group buffer, unsubscribe from (or subscribe to) the group listed
in the line that point is on.  When you quit Gnus by typing <kbd>q</kbd>,
Gnus lists in your <code>.newsrc</code> file which groups you have subscribed
to.  The next time you start Gnus, you won't see this group,
because Gnus normally displays only subscribed-to groups.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k</kbd>
     <dd>In the group buffer, "kill" the current line's group--don't
even list it in <code>.newsrc</code> from now on.  This affects future
Gnus sessions as well as the present session.

     <p>When you quit Gnus by typing <kbd>q</kbd>, Gnus writes information
in the file <code>.newsrc</code> describing all newsgroups except those you
have "killed."

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>In the group buffer, select the group on the line under the cursor
and display the first unread article in that group.

     <p>In the summary buffer,

          <ul>
<li>Select the article on the line under the cursor if none is selected.

          <li>Scroll the text of the selected article (if there is one).

          <li>Select the next unread article if at the end of the current article. 
</ul>

     <p>Thus, you can move through all the articles by repeatedly typing &lt;SPC&gt;.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>In the group buffer, move point to the previous group containing
unread articles.

     <p>In the summary buffer, scroll the text of the article backwards.

     <br><dt><kbd>n</kbd>
     <dd>Move point to the next unread group, or select the next unread article.

     <br><dt><kbd>p</kbd>
     <dd>Move point to the previous unread group, or select the previous
unread article.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-n</kbd>
     <dd><dt><kbd>C-p</kbd>
     <dd>Move point to the next or previous item, even if it is marked as read. 
This does not select the article or group on that line.

     <br><dt><kbd>s</kbd>
     <dd>In the summary buffer, do an incremental search of the current text in
the article buffer, just as if you switched to the article buffer and
typed <kbd>C-s</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-s </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>In the summary buffer, search forward for articles containing a match
for <var>regexp</var>.

   </dl>
