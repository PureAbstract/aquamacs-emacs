<h3 class="section"><code>movemail</code> and POP</h3>

<p>When getting new mail, Rmail first copies the new mail from the inbox
file to the Rmail file; then it saves the Rmail file; then it truncates
the inbox file.  This way, a system crash may cause duplication of mail
between the inbox and the Rmail file, but cannot lose mail.  If
<code>rmail-preserve-inbox</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then Rmail will copy new
mail from the inbox file to the Rmail file without truncating the inbox
file.  You may wish to set this, for example, on a portable computer you
use to check your mail via POP while traveling, so that your mail will
remain on the server and you can save it later on your workstation.

   <p>In some cases, Rmail copies the new mail from the inbox file
indirectly.  First it runs the <code>movemail</code> program to move the mail
from the inbox to an intermediate file called
<code>~/.newmail-</code><var>inboxname</var><code></code>.  Then Rmail merges the new mail from
that file, saves the Rmail file, and only then deletes the intermediate
file.  If there is a crash at the wrong time, this file continues to
exist, and Rmail will use it again the next time it gets new mail from
that inbox.

   <p>If Rmail is unable to convert the data in
<code>~/.newmail-</code><var>inboxname</var><code></code> into Babyl format, it renames the file
to <code>~/RMAILOSE.</code><var>n</var><code></code> (<var>n</var> is an integer chosen to make the
name unique) so that Rmail will not have trouble with the data again. 
You should look at the file, find whatever message confuses Rmail
(probably one that includes the control-underscore character, octal code
037), and delete it.  Then you can use <kbd>1 g</kbd> to get new mail from
the corrected file.

   <p>Some sites use a method called POP for accessing users' inbox data
instead of storing the data in inbox files.  <code>movemail</code> can work
with POP if you compile it with the macro <code>MAIL_USE_POP</code> defined. 
(You can achieve that by specifying <code>--with-pop</code> when you run
<code>configure</code> during the installation of Emacs.) 
<code>movemail</code> only works with POP3, not with older
versions of POP.

   <p>Assuming you have compiled and installed <code>movemail</code>
appropriately, you can specify a POP inbox by using a "file name" of
the form <code>po:</code><var>username</var><code></code>, in the inbox list of an Rmail file. 
<code>movemail</code> handles such a name by opening a connection to the POP
server.  The <code>MAILHOST</code> environment variable specifies the machine
to look for the server on; alternatively, you can specify the POP server
host name as part of the mailbox name using the syntax
<code>po:</code><var>username</var><code>:</code><var>hostname</var><code></code>.

   <p>Accessing mail via POP may require a password.  If the variable
<code>rmail-pop-password</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, it specifies the password
to use for POP.  Alternatively, if <code>rmail-pop-password-required</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, then Rmail asks you for the password to use.

   <p>If you need to pass additional command-line flags to <code>movemail</code>,
set the variable <code>rmail-movemail-flags</code> a list of the flags you
wish to use.  Do not use this variable to pass the <code>-p</code> flag to
preserve your inbox contents; use <code>rmail-preserve-inbox</code> instead.

   <p>The <code>movemail</code> program installed at your site may support
Kerberos authentication.  If it is
supported, it is used by default whenever you attempt to retrieve
POP mail when <code>rmail-pop-password</code> and
<code>rmail-pop-password-required</code> are unset.

   <p>Some POP servers store messages in reverse order.  If your server does
this, and you would rather read your mail in the order in which it was
received, you can tell <code>movemail</code> to reverse the order of
downloaded messages by adding the <code>-r</code> flag to
<code>rmail-movemail-flags</code>.
