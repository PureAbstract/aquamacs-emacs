<p>During the merge, you mustn't try to edit the A and B buffers yourself. 
Emerge modifies them temporarily, but ultimately puts them back the way
they were.

   <p>You can have any number of merges going at once--just don't use any one
buffer as input to more than one merge at once, since the temporary
changes made in these buffers would get in each other's way.

   <p>Starting Emerge can take a long time because it needs to compare the
files fully.  Emacs can't do anything else until <code>diff</code> finishes. 
Perhaps in the future someone will change Emerge to do the comparison in
the background when the input files are large--then you could keep on
doing other things with Emacs until Emerge is ready to accept
commands.

   <p>After setting up the merge, Emerge runs the hook
<code>emerge-startup-hook</code> (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>).
