<h3 class="subsection">Local Variables in Files</h4>

<p>A file can specify local variable values for use when you edit the
file with Emacs.  Visiting the file checks for local variable
specifications; it automatically makes these variables local to the
buffer, and sets them to the values specified in the file.

   <p>There are two ways to specify local variable values: in the first
line, or with a local variables list.  Here's how to specify them in the
first line:

<pre class="example">     -*- mode: <var>modename</var>; <var>var</var>: <var>value</var>; ... -*-
     </pre>

<p>You can specify any number of variables/value pairs in this way, each
pair with a colon and semicolon as shown above.  <code>mode:
</code><var>modename</var><code>;</code> specifies the major mode; this should come first in the
line.  The <var>value</var>s are not evaluated; they are used literally. 
Here is an example that specifies Lisp mode and sets two variables with
numeric values:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;; -*- mode: Lisp; fill-column: 75; comment-column: 50; -*-
     </pre>

   <p>You can also specify the coding system for a file in this way: just
specify a value for the "variable" named <code>coding</code>.  The "value"
must be a coding system name that Emacs recognizes.  See <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding%20Systems">Coding Systems</a>.

   <p>The <code>eval</code> pseudo-variable, described below, can be specified in
the first line as well.

   <p>In shell scripts, the first line is used to identify the script
interpreter, so you cannot put any local variables there.  To accommodate
for this, when Emacs visits a shell script, it looks for local variable
specifications in the <em>second</em> line.

   <p>A <dfn>local variables list</dfn> goes near the end of the file, in the
last page.  (It is often best to put it on a page by itself.)  The local
variables list starts with a line containing the string <code>Local
Variables:</code>, and ends with a line containing the string <code>End:</code>.  In
between come the variable names and values, one set per line, as
<code></code><var>variable</var><code>: </code><var>value</var><code></code>.  The <var>value</var>s are not
evaluated; they are used literally.  If a file has both a local
variables list and a <code>-*-</code> line, Emacs processes <em>everything</em>
in the <code>-*-</code> line first, and <em>everything</em> in the local
variables list afterward.

   <p>Here is an example of a local variables list:

<pre class="example">     ;;; Local Variables: ***
     ;;; mode:lisp ***
     ;;; comment-column:0 ***
     ;;; comment-start: ";;; "  ***
     ;;; comment-end:"***" ***
     ;;; End: ***
     </pre>

   <p>As you see, each line starts with the prefix <code>;;; </code> and each line
ends with the suffix <code> ***</code>.  Emacs recognizes these as the prefix
and suffix based on the first line of the list, by finding them
surrounding the magic string <code>Local Variables:</code>; then it
automatically discards them from the other lines of the list.

   <p>The usual reason for using a prefix and/or suffix is to embed the
local variables list in a comment, so it won't confuse other programs
that the file is intended as input for.  The example above is for a
language where comment lines start with <code>;;; </code> and end with
<code>***</code>; the local values for <code>comment-start</code> and
<code>comment-end</code> customize the rest of Emacs for this unusual syntax. 
Don't use a prefix (or a suffix) if you don't need one.

   <p>Two "variable names" have special meanings in a local variables
list: a value for the variable <code>mode</code> really sets the major mode,
and a value for the variable <code>eval</code> is simply evaluated as an
expression and the value is ignored.  <code>mode</code> and <code>eval</code> are
not real variables; setting variables named <code>mode</code> and <code>eval</code>
in any other context has no special meaning.  <em>If </em><code>mode</code><em> is
used to set a major mode, it should be the first "variable" in the
list.</em>  Otherwise, the entries that precede it in the list of the local
variables are likely to be ignored, since most modes kill all local
variables as part of their initialization.

   <p>You can use the <code>mode</code> "variable" to set minor modes as well as
major modes; in fact, you can use it more than once, first to set the
major mode and then to set minor modes which are specific to particular
buffers.  But most minor modes should not be specified in the file in
any fashion, because they represent user preferences.

   <p>For example, you may be tempted to try to turn on Auto Fill mode with
a local variable list.  That is a mistake.  The choice of Auto Fill mode
or not is a matter of individual taste, not a matter of the contents of
particular files.  If you want to use Auto Fill, set up major mode hooks
with your <code>.emacs</code> file to turn it on (when appropriate) for you
alone (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init%20File">Init File</a>).  Don't use a local variable list to impose
your taste on everyone.

   <p>The start of the local variables list must be no more than 3000
characters from the end of the file, and must be in the last page if the
file is divided into pages.  Otherwise, Emacs will not notice it is
there.  The purpose of this rule is so that a stray <code>Local
Variables:</code> not in the last page does not confuse Emacs, and so that
visiting a long file that is all one page and has no local variables
list need not take the time to search the whole file.

   <p>Use the command <code>normal-mode</code> to reset the local variables and
major mode of a buffer according to the file name and contents,
including the local variables list if any.  See <a href="Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing%20Modes">Choosing Modes</a>.

   <p>The variable <code>enable-local-variables</code> controls whether to process
local variables in files, and thus gives you a chance to override them. 
Its default value is <code>t</code>, which means do process local variables in
files.  If you set the value to <code>nil</code>, Emacs simply ignores local
variables in files.  Any other value says to query you about each file
that has local variables, showing you the local variable specifications
so you can judge.

   <p>The <code>eval</code> "variable," and certain actual variables, create a
special risk; when you visit someone else's file, local variable
specifications for these could affect your Emacs in arbitrary ways. 
Therefore, the option <code>enable-local-eval</code> controls whether Emacs
processes <code>eval</code> variables, as well variables with names that end
in <code>-hook</code>, <code>-hooks</code>, <code>-function</code> or <code>-functions</code>,
and certain other variables.  The three possibilities for the option's
value are <code>t</code>, <code>nil</code>, and anything else, just as for
<code>enable-local-variables</code>.  The default is <code>maybe</code>, which is
neither <code>t</code> nor <code>nil</code>, so normally Emacs does ask for
confirmation about file settings for these variables.
