<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.11.3 Options specific for CVS</h5>

<p><a name="index-locking-_0028CVS_0029-2500"></a>  By default, CVS does not use locking to coordinate the activities of
several users; anyone can change a work file at any time.  However,
there are ways to restrict this, resulting in behavior that resembles
locking.

   <p><a name="index-CVSREAD-environment-variable-_0028CVS_0029-2501"></a>  For one thing, you can set the <samp><span class="env">CVSREAD</span></samp> environment variable
(the value you use makes no difference).  If this variable is defined,
CVS makes your work files read-only by default.  In Emacs, you must
type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> to make the file writable, so that editing works
in fact similar as if locking was used.  Note however, that no actual
locking is performed, so several users can make their files writable
at the same time.  When setting <samp><span class="env">CVSREAD</span></samp> for the first time, make
sure to check out all your modules anew, so that the file protections
are set correctly.

   <p><a name="index-cvs-watch-feature-2502"></a><a name="index-watching-files-_0028CVS_0029-2503"></a>  Another way to achieve something similar to locking is to use the
<dfn>watch</dfn> feature of CVS.  If a file is being watched, CVS makes it
read-only by default, and you must also use <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> in Emacs to
make it writable.  VC calls <code>cvs edit</code> to make the file writable,
and CVS takes care to notify other developers of the fact that you
intend to change the file.  See the CVS documentation for details on
using the watch feature.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dstay_002dlocal-2504"></a><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dstay_002dlocal-2505"></a><a name="index-remote-repositories-_0028CVS_0029-2506"></a>  When a file's repository is on a remote machine, VC tries to keep
network interactions to a minimum.  This is controlled by the variable
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code>.  There is another variable,
<code>vc-stay-local</code>, which enables the feature also for other back
ends that support it, including CVS.  In the following, we will talk
only about <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code>, but everything applies to
<code>vc-stay-local</code> as well.

   <p>If <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> is <code>t</code> (the default), then VC uses
only the entry in the local CVS subdirectory to determine the file's
state (and possibly information returned by previous CVS commands). 
One consequence of this is that when you have modified a file, and
somebody else has already checked in other changes to the file, you
are not notified of it until you actually try to commit.  (But you can
try to pick up any recent changes from the repository first, using
<kbd>C-x v m &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>,
see <a href="Merging.html#Merging">Merging</a>).

   <p>When <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> is <code>t</code>, VC also makes local
version backups, so that simple diff and revert operations are
completely local (see <a href="Version-Backups.html#Version-Backups">Version Backups</a>).

   <p>On the other hand, if you set <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to <code>nil</code>,
then VC queries the remote repository <em>before</em> it decides what to
do in <code>vc-next-action</code> (<kbd>C-x v v</kbd>), just as it does for local
repositories.  It also does not make any version backups.

   <p>You can also set <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to a regular expression
that is matched against the repository host name; VC then stays local
only for repositories from hosts that match the pattern.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dglobal_002dswitches-2507"></a>  You can specify additional command line options to pass to all CVS
operations in the variable <code>vc-cvs-global-switches</code>.  These
switches are inserted immediately after the <code>cvs</code> command, before
the name of the operation to invoke.
