<h3 class="subsection">Format of Outlines</h4>

<p>Outline mode assumes that the lines in the buffer are of two types:
<dfn>heading lines</dfn> and <dfn>body lines</dfn>.  A heading line represents a
topic in the outline.  Heading lines start with one or more stars; the
number of stars determines the depth of the heading in the outline
structure.  Thus, a heading line with one star is a major topic; all the
heading lines with two stars between it and the next one-star heading
are its subtopics; and so on.  Any line that is not a heading line is a
body line.  Body lines belong with the preceding heading line.  Here is
an example:

<pre class="example">     * Food
     This is the body,
     which says something about the topic of food.
     
     ** Delicious Food
     This is the body of the second-level header.
     
     ** Distasteful Food
     This could have
     a body too, with
     several lines.
     
     *** Dormitory Food
     
     * Shelter
     Another first-level topic with its header line.
     </pre>

   <p>A heading line together with all following body lines is called
collectively an <dfn>entry</dfn>.  A heading line together with all following
deeper heading lines and their body lines is called a <dfn>subtree</dfn>.

   <p>You can customize the criterion for distinguishing heading lines
by setting the variable <code>outline-regexp</code>.  Any line whose
beginning has a match for this regexp is considered a heading line. 
Matches that start within a line (not at the left margin) do not count. 
The length of the matching text determines the level of the heading;
longer matches make a more deeply nested level.  Thus, for example,
if a text formatter has commands <code>@chapter</code>, <code>@section</code>
and <code>@subsection</code> to divide the document into chapters and
sections, you could make those lines count as heading lines by
setting <code>outline-regexp</code> to <code>"@chap\\|@\\(sub\\)*section"</code>. 
Note the trick: the two words <code>chapter</code> and <code>section</code> are equally
long, but by defining the regexp to match only <code>chap</code> we ensure
that the length of the text matched on a chapter heading is shorter,
so that Outline mode will know that sections are contained in chapters. 
This works as long as no other command starts with <code>@chap</code>.

   <p>You can change the rule for calculating the level of a heading line
by setting the variable <code>outline-level</code>.  The value of
<code>outline-level</code> should be a function that takes no arguments and
returns the level of the current heading.  Some major modes such as C,
Nroff, and Emacs Lisp mode set this variable and <code>outline-regexp</code>
in order to work with Outline minor mode.
