<h3 class="subsection">Backup Files</h4>

<p>On most operating systems, rewriting a file automatically destroys all
record of what the file used to contain.  Thus, saving a file from Emacs
throws away the old contents of the file--or it would, except that
Emacs carefully copies the old contents to another file, called the
<dfn>backup</dfn> file, before actually saving.

   <p>For most files, the variable <code>make-backup-files</code> determines
whether to make backup files.  On most operating systems, its default
value is <code>t</code>, so that Emacs does write backup files.

   <p>For files managed by a version control system (see <a href="Version-Control.html#Version%20Control">Version Control</a>), the variable <code>vc-make-backup-files</code> determines whether
to make backup files.  By default it is <code>nil</code>, since backup files
are redundant when you store all the previous versions in a version
control system.  See <a href="General-VC-Options.html#General%20VC%20Options">General VC Options</a>.

   <p>The default value of the <code>backup-enable-predicate</code> variable
prevents backup files being written for files in the directories used
for temporary files, specified by <code>temporary-file-directory</code> or
<code>small-temporary-file-directory</code>.

   <p>At your option, Emacs can keep either a single backup file or a series of
numbered backup files for each file that you edit.

   <p>Emacs makes a backup for a file only the first time the file is saved
from one buffer.  No matter how many times you save a file, its backup file
continues to contain the contents from before the file was visited. 
Normally this means that the backup file contains the contents from before
the current editing session; however, if you kill the buffer and then visit
the file again, a new backup file will be made by the next save.

   <p>You can also explicitly request making another backup file from a
buffer even though it has already been saved at least once.  If you save
the buffer with <kbd>C-u C-x C-s</kbd>, the version thus saved will be made
into a backup file if you save the buffer again.  <kbd>C-u C-u C-x C-s</kbd>
saves the buffer, but first makes the previous file contents into a new
backup file.  <kbd>C-u C-u C-u C-x C-s</kbd> does both things: it makes a
backup from the previous contents, and arranges to make another from the
newly saved contents if you save again.
