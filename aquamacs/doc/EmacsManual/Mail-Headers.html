<h3 class="section">35.2 Mail Header Fields</h3>

<p><a name="index-headers-_0028of-mail-message_0029-2672"></a>
  A header field in the mail buffer starts with a field name at the
beginning of a line, terminated by a colon.  Upper and lower case are
equivalent in field names (and in mailing addresses also).  After the
colon and optional whitespace comes the contents of the field.

   <p>You can use any name you like for a header field, but normally people
use only standard field names with accepted meanings.  Here is a table
of fields commonly used in outgoing messages.  Emacs preinitializes some
of these when you start to compose a mail, depending on various options
you can set.  You can delete or alter any header field before you send
the message, if you wish.

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>'<dd>This field contains the mailing addresses to which the message is
addressed.  If you list more than one address, use commas, not spaces,
to separate them.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>'<dd>The contents of the `<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>' field should be a piece of text
that says what the message is about.  The reason `<samp><span class="samp">Subject</span></samp>' fields
are useful is that most mail-reading programs can provide a summary of
messages, listing the subject of each message but not its text.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>'<dd>This field contains additional mailing addresses to send the message to,
like `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>' except that these readers should not regard the message
as directed at them.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">BCC</span></samp>'<dd>This field contains additional mailing addresses to send the message to,
which should not appear in the header of the message actually sent. 
Copies sent this way are called <dfn>blind carbon copies</dfn>.

     <p><a name="index-mail_002dself_002dblind-2673"></a><a name="index-copy-of-every-outgoing-message-2674"></a>To send a blind carbon copy of every outgoing message to yourself, set
the variable <code>mail-self-blind</code> to <code>t</code>.  To send a blind carbon
copy of every message to some other <var>address</var>, set the variable
<code>mail-default-headers</code> to <code>"Bcc: </code><var>address</var><code>\n"</code>.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">FCC</span></samp>'<dd>This field contains the name of one file and directs Emacs to append a
copy of the message to that file when you send the message.  Emacs
writes the message in mbox format, unless the file is in Babyl format
(used by Rmail before Emacs 23), in which case Emacs writes Babyl.  If
an Rmail buffer is visiting the file, Emacs updates it accordingly. 
To specify more than one file, use several `<samp><span class="samp">FCC</span></samp>' fields, with one
file name in each field.

     <p><a name="index-mail_002darchive_002dfile_002dname-2675"></a>To put a fixed file name in the `<samp><span class="samp">FCC</span></samp>' field each time you start
editing an outgoing message, set the variable
<code>mail-archive-file-name</code> to that file name.  Unless you remove the
`<samp><span class="samp">FCC</span></samp>' field before sending, the message will be written into that
file when it is sent.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>'<dd>Use the `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' field to say who you are.  You might need to change
this if the account you are using to send the mail is not your own.  The
contents of the `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' field should be a valid mailing address,
since replies will normally go there.

     <p><a name="index-mail_002dsetup_002dwith_002dfrom-2676"></a>Emacs initializes this field (unless the variable
<code>mail-setup-with-from</code> is <code>nil</code>) using
<code>user-mail-address</code> as the default.  If there is no `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>'
field when you send a mail, Emacs adds one.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>'<dd>Use this field to direct replies to a different address.  Most
mail-reading programs (including Rmail) automatically send replies to
the `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>' address in preference to the `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' address. 
By adding a `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>' field to your header, you can work around
any problems your `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' address may cause for replies.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bREPLYTO_007d-environment-variable-2677"></a><a name="index-mail_002ddefault_002dreply_002dto-2678"></a>To put a fixed `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>' address into every outgoing message, set
the variable <code>mail-default-reply-to</code> to that address (as a string). 
Then Emacs initializes the message with a `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>' field as
specified.  When you first compose a mail, if
<code>mail-default-reply-to</code> is <code>nil</code>, Emacs initializes it from the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">REPLYTO</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Mail-reply-to</span></samp>'<dd>  This field takes precedence over `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>'.  It is used because
some mailing lists set the `<samp><span class="samp">Reply-to</span></samp>' field for their own purposes
(a somewhat controversial practice).

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Mail-followup-to</span></samp>'<dd>  This field contains one or more addresses.  It is typically used when
you reply to a message from a mailing list that you are subscribed to. 
It usually indicates that you want replies to go to the list, and that
you do not need an extra copy sent directly to you.

     <p><a name="index-mail_002dmailing_002dlists-2679"></a>  The variable <code>mail-mailing-lists</code> holds a list of mailing list
addresses that you are subscribed to.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs
inserts an appropriate `<samp><span class="samp">Mail-followup-to</span></samp>' header when sending mail
to a mailing list.

     <!-- There is also "Sent-via", added by C-c C-v, but it does not seem -->
<!-- particularly useful (?). -->
<br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">In-reply-to</span></samp>'<dd>This field contains a piece of text describing the message you are
replying to.  Some mail systems can use this information to correlate
related pieces of mail.  Normally this field is filled in by Rmail
when you reply to a message in Rmail, and you never need to
think about it (see <a href="Rmail.html#Rmail">Rmail</a>).

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">References</span></samp>'<dd>This field lists the Message-Ids of related previous messages (a
Message-Id is a unique identifier generated when a message is sent). 
Rmail sets up this field automatically when you reply to a message. 
</dl>

   <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">CC</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">BCC</span></samp>' header fields can appear
any number of times, and each such header field can contain multiple
addresses, separated by commas.  This way, you can specify any number
of places to send the message.  These fields can also have
continuation lines: one or more lines starting with whitespace,
following the starting line of the field, are considered part of the
field.  Here's an example of a `<samp><span class="samp">To</span></samp>' field with a continuation
line:

<pre class="example">     To: foo@here.net, this@there.net,
       me@gnu.cambridge.mass.usa.earth.spiral3281
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-mail_002dfrom_002dstyle-2680"></a>  When you send the message, if you didn't write a `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' field
yourself, Emacs puts in one for you, using <code>user-mail-address</code>. 
The variable <code>mail-from-style</code> controls the format:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Use just the email address, as in `<samp><span class="samp">king@grassland.com</span></samp>'. 
<br><dt><code>parens</code><dd>Use both email address and full name, as in:<br>
`<samp><span class="samp">king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)</span></samp>'. 
<br><dt><code>angles</code><dd>Use both email address and full name, as in:<br>
`<samp><span class="samp">Elvis Parsley &lt;king@grassland.com&gt;</span></samp>'. 
<br><dt><code>system-default</code><dd>Allow the system to insert the `<samp><span class="samp">From</span></samp>' field. 
</dl>

<!-- There is also mail-specify-envelope-from and mail-envelope-from, but -->
<!-- these are probably not topics for the Emacs manual. -->
<p><a name="index-mail_002ddefault_002dheaders-2681"></a>  You can direct Emacs to insert certain default headers into the
outgoing message by setting the variable <code>mail-default-headers</code>
to a string.  Then <code>C-x m</code> inserts this string into the message
headers.  If the default header fields are not appropriate for a
particular message, edit them as necessary before sending the message.
