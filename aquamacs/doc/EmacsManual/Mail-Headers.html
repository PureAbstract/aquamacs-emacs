<h3 class="section">Mail Header Fields</h3>

<p>A header field in the mail buffer starts with a field name at the
beginning of a line, terminated by a colon.  Upper and lower case are
equivalent in field names (and in mailing addresses also).  After the
colon and optional whitespace comes the contents of the field.

   <p>You can use any name you like for a header field, but normally people
use only standard field names with accepted meanings.  Here is a table
of fields commonly used in outgoing messages.

     <dl>
<dt><code>To</code>
     <dd>This field contains the mailing addresses to which the message is
addressed.  If you list more than one address, use commas, not spaces,
to separate them.

     <br><dt><code>Subject</code>
     <dd>The contents of the <code>Subject</code> field should be a piece of text
that says what the message is about.  The reason <code>Subject</code> fields
are useful is that most mail-reading programs can provide a summary of
messages, listing the subject of each message but not its text.

     <br><dt><code>CC</code>
     <dd>This field contains additional mailing addresses to send the message to,
like <code>To</code> except that these readers should not regard the message
as directed at them.

     <br><dt><code>BCC</code>
     <dd>This field contains additional mailing addresses to send the message to,
which should not appear in the header of the message actually sent. 
Copies sent this way are called <dfn>blind carbon copies</dfn>.

     <p>To send a blind carbon copy of every outgoing message to yourself, set
the variable <code>mail-self-blind</code> to <code>t</code>.  To send a blind carbon
copy of every message to some other <var>address</var>, set the variable
<code>mail-default-headers</code> to <code>"Bcc: </code><var>address</var><code>\n"</code>.

     <br><dt><code>FCC</code>
     <dd>This field contains the name of one file and directs Emacs to append a
copy of the message to that file when you send the message.  If the file
is in Rmail format, Emacs writes the message in Rmail format; otherwise,
Emacs writes the message in system mail file format.  To specify
more than one file, use several <code>FCC</code> fields, with one file
name in each field.

     <p>To put a fixed file name in the <code>FCC</code> field each time you start
editing an outgoing message, set the variable
<code>mail-archive-file-name</code> to that file name.  Unless you remove the
<code>FCC</code> field before sending, the message will be written into that
file when it is sent.

     <br><dt><code>From</code>
     <dd>Use the <code>From</code> field to say who you are, when the account you are
using to send the mail is not your own.  The contents of the <code>From</code>
field should be a valid mailing address, since replies will normally go
there.  If you don't specify the <code>From</code> field yourself, Emacs uses
the value of <code>user-mail-address</code> as the default.

     <br><dt><code>Reply-to</code>
     <dd>Use this field to direct replies to a different address.  Most
mail-reading programs (including Rmail) automatically send replies to
the <code>Reply-to</code> address in preference to the <code>From</code> address. 
By adding a <code>Reply-to</code> field to your header, you can work around
any problems your <code>From</code> address may cause for replies.

     <p>To put a fixed <code>Reply-to</code> address into every outgoing message, set
the variable <code>mail-default-reply-to</code> to that address (as a string). 
Then <code>mail</code> initializes the message with a <code>Reply-to</code> field as
specified.  You can delete or alter that header field before you send
the message, if you wish.  When Emacs starts up, if the environment
variable <code>REPLYTO</code> is set, <code>mail-default-reply-to</code> is
initialized from that environment variable.

     <br><dt><code>In-reply-to</code>
     <dd>This field contains a piece of text describing the message you are
replying to.  Some mail systems can use this information to correlate
related pieces of mail.  Normally this field is filled in by Rmail
when you reply to a message in Rmail, and you never need to
think about it (see <a href="Rmail.html#Rmail">Rmail</a>).

     <br><dt><code>References</code>
     <dd>This field lists the message IDs of related previous messages.  Rmail
sets up this field automatically when you reply to a message. 
</dl>

   <p>The <code>To</code>, <code>CC</code>, and <code>BCC</code> header fields can appear
any number of times, and each such header field can contain multiple
addresses, separated by commas.  This way, you can specify any number
of places to send the message.  These fields can also have
continuation lines: one or more lines starting with whitespace,
following the starting line of the field, are considered part of the
field.  Here's an example of a <code>To</code> field with a continuation
line:

<pre class="example">     To: foo@here.net, this@there.net,
       me@gnu.cambridge.mass.usa.earth.spiral3281
     </pre>

   <p>When you send the message, if you didn't write a <code>From</code> field
yourself, Emacs puts in one for you.  The variable
<code>mail-from-style</code> controls the format:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code>
     <dd>Use just the email address, as in <code>king@grassland.com</code>. 
<br><dt><code>parens</code>
     <dd>Use both email address and full name, as in <code>king@grassland.com (Elvis
Parsley)</code>. 
<br><dt><code>angles</code>
     <dd>Use both email address and full name, as in <code>Elvis Parsley
&lt;king@grassland.com&gt;</code>. 
<br><dt><code>system-default</code>
     <dd>Allow the system to insert the <code>From</code> field. 
</dl>

   <p>You can direct Emacs to insert certain default headers into the
outgoing message by setting the variable <code>mail-default-headers</code>
to a string.  Then <code>C-x m</code> inserts this string into the message
headers.  If the default header fields are not appropriate for a
particular message, edit them as appropriate before sending the
message.
