<h3 class="section">Deleting Files with Dired</h3>

<p>One of the most frequent uses of Dired is to first <dfn>flag</dfn> files for
deletion, then delete the files that were flagged.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd>
     <dd>Flag this file for deletion. 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd>
     <dd>Remove deletion flag on this line. 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Move point to previous line and remove the deletion flag on that line. 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd>
     <dd>Delete the files that are flagged for deletion. 
</dl>

   <p>You can flag a file for deletion by moving to the line describing the
file and typing <kbd>d</kbd> (<code>dired-flag-file-deletion</code>).  The deletion flag is visible as a <code>D</code> at
the beginning of the line.  This command moves point to the next line,
so that repeated <kbd>d</kbd> commands flag successive files.  A numeric
argument serves as a repeat count.

   <p>The variable <code>dired-recursive-deletes</code> controls whether the
delete command will delete non-empty directories (including their
contents).  The default is to delete only empty directories.

   <p>The files are flagged for deletion rather than deleted immediately to
reduce the danger of deleting a file accidentally.  Until you direct
Dired to delete the flagged files, you can remove deletion flags using
the commands <kbd>u</kbd> and &lt;DEL&gt;.  <kbd>u</kbd> (<code>dired-unmark</code>) works
just like <kbd>d</kbd>, but removes flags rather than making flags. 
&lt;DEL&gt; (<code>dired-unmark-backward</code>) moves upward, removing flags;
it is like <kbd>u</kbd> with argument -1.

   <p>To delete the flagged files, type <kbd>x</kbd> (<code>dired-do-flagged-delete</code>). 
(This is also known as <dfn>expunging</dfn>.) 
This command first displays a list of all the file names flagged for
deletion, and requests confirmation with <kbd>yes</kbd>.  If you confirm,
Dired deletes the flagged files, then deletes their lines from the text
of the Dired buffer.  The shortened Dired buffer remains selected.

   <p>If you answer <kbd>no</kbd> or quit with <kbd>C-g</kbd> when asked to confirm, you
return immediately to Dired, with the deletion flags still present in
the buffer, and no files actually deleted.
