<h3 class="subsubsection">Concepts of Version Control</h5>

<p>When a file is under version control, we also say that it is
<dfn>registered</dfn> in the version control system.  Each registered file
has a corresponding <dfn>master file</dfn> which represents the file's
present state plus its change history--enough to reconstruct the
current version or any earlier version.  Usually the master file also
records a <dfn>log entry</dfn> for each version, describing in words what was
changed in that version.

   <p>The file that is maintained under version control is sometimes called
the <dfn>work file</dfn> corresponding to its master file.  You edit the work
file and make changes in it, as you would with an ordinary file.  (With
SCCS and RCS, you must <dfn>lock</dfn> the file before you start to edit it.) 
After you are done with a set of changes, you <dfn>check the file in</dfn>,
which records the changes in the master file, along with a log entry for
them.

   <p>With CVS, there are usually multiple work files corresponding to a
single master file--often each user has his own copy.  It is also
possible to use RCS in this way, but this is not the usual way to use
RCS.

   <p>A version control system typically has some mechanism to coordinate
between users who want to change the same file.  One method is
<dfn>locking</dfn> (analogous to the locking that Emacs uses to detect
simultaneous editing of a file, but distinct from it).  The other method
is to merge your changes with other people's changes when you check them
in.

   <p>With version control locking, work files are normally read-only so
that you cannot change them.  You ask the version control system to make
a work file writable for you by locking it; only one user can do
this at any given time.  When you check in your changes, that unlocks
the file, making the work file read-only again.  This allows other users
to lock the file to make further changes.  SCCS always uses locking, and
RCS normally does.

   <p>The other alternative for RCS is to let each user modify the work file
at any time.  In this mode, locking is not required, but it is
permitted; check-in is still the way to record a new version.

   <p>CVS normally allows each user to modify his own copy of the work file
at any time, but requires merging with changes from other users at
check-in time.  However, CVS can also be set up to require locking.
