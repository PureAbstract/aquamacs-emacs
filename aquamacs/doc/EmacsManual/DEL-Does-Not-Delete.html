<h3 class="subsection">If &lt;DEL&gt; Fails to Delete</h4>

<p>Every keyboard has a large key, a little ways above the &lt;RET&gt; or
&lt;ENTER&gt; key, which you normally use outside Emacs to erase the
last character that you typed.  We call this key <dfn>the usual
erasure key</dfn>.  In Emacs, it is supposed to be equivalent to &lt;DEL&gt;,
and when Emacs is properly configured for your terminal, it translates
that key into the character &lt;DEL&gt;.

   <p>When Emacs starts up using a window system, it determines
automatically which key should be &lt;DEL&gt;.  In some unusual cases
Emacs gets the wrong information from the system.  If the usual
erasure key deletes forwards instead of backwards, that is probably
what happened--Emacs ought to be treating the &lt;DELETE&gt; key as
&lt;DEL&gt;, but it isn't.

   <p>With a window system, if the usual erasure key is labeled
&lt;BACKSPACE&gt; and there is a &lt;DELETE&gt; key elsewhere, but the
&lt;DELETE&gt; key deletes backward instead of forward, that too
suggests Emacs got the wrong information--but in the opposite sense. 
It ought to be treating the &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key as &lt;DEL&gt;, and
treating &lt;DELETE&gt; differently, but it isn't.

   <p>On a text-only terminal, if you find the usual erasure key prompts
for a Help command, like <kbd>Control-h</kbd>, instead of deleting a
character, it means that key is actually sending the &lt;BS&gt;
character.  Emacs ought to be treating &lt;BS&gt; as &lt;DEL&gt;, but it
isn't.

   <p>In all of those cases, the immediate remedy is the same: use the
command <kbd>M-x normal-erase-is-backspace-mode</kbd>.  This toggles
between the two modes that Emacs supports for handling &lt;DEL&gt;, so
if Emacs starts in the wrong mode, it should switch to the right mode. 
On a text-only terminal, if you want to ask for help when &lt;BS&gt; is
treated as &lt;DEL&gt;, use &lt;F1&gt;; <kbd>C-?</kbd> may also work, if it
sends character code 127.

   <p>To fix the problem automatically for every Emacs session, you can
put one of the following lines into your <code>.emacs</code> file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init%20File">Init File</a>).  For the first case above, where &lt;DELETE&gt;
deletes forwards instead of backwards, use this line to make
&lt;DELETE&gt; act as &lt;DEL&gt; (resulting in behavior compatible
with Emacs 20 and previous versions):

<pre class="lisp">     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 0)
     </pre>

<p>For the other two cases, where &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; ought to act as
&lt;DEL&gt;, use this line:

<pre class="lisp">     (normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 1)
     </pre>

   <p>Another way to fix the problem for every Emacs session is to
customize the variable <code>normal-erase-is-backspace</code>: the value
<code>t</code> specifies the mode where &lt;BS&gt; or &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; is
&lt;DEL&gt;, and <code>nil</code> specifies the other mode.  See <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy%20Customization">Easy Customization</a>.

   <p>With a window system, it can also happen that the usual erasure key
is labeled &lt;BACKSPACE&gt;, there is a &lt;DELETE&gt; key elsewhere, and
both keys delete forward.  This probably means that someone has
redefined your &lt;BACKSPACE&gt; key as a &lt;DELETE&gt; key.  With X,
this is typically done with a command to the <code>xmodmap</code> program
when you start the server or log in.  The most likely motive for this
customization was to support old versions of Emacs, so we recommend
you simply remove it now.
