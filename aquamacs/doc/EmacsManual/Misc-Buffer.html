   <p>A buffer can be <dfn>read-only</dfn>, which means that commands to change
its contents are not allowed.  The mode line indicates read-only
buffers with <code>%%</code> or <code>%*</code> near the left margin.  Read-only
buffers are usually made by subsystems such as Dired and Rmail that
have special commands to operate on the text; also by visiting a file
whose access control says you cannot write it.

   <p>If you wish to make changes in a read-only buffer, use the command
<kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> (<code>vc-toggle-read-only</code>).  It makes a read-only buffer
writable, and makes a writable buffer read-only.  In most cases, this
works by setting the variable <code>buffer-read-only</code>, which has a local
value in each buffer and makes the buffer read-only if its value is
non-<code>nil</code>.  If the file is maintained with version control,
<kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> works through the version control system to change the
read-only status of the file as well as the buffer.  See <a href="Version-Control.html#Version%20Control">Version Control</a>.

   <p><kbd>M-x rename-buffer</kbd> changes the name of the current buffer.  Specify
the new name as a minibuffer argument.  There is no default.  If you
specify a name that is in use for some other buffer, an error happens and
no renaming is done.

   <p><kbd>M-x rename-uniquely</kbd> renames the current buffer to a similar name
with a numeric suffix added to make it both different and unique.  This
command does not need an argument.  It is useful for creating multiple
shell buffers: if you rename the <code>*Shell*</code> buffer, then do <kbd>M-x
shell</kbd> again, it makes a new shell buffer named <code>*Shell*</code>;
meanwhile, the old shell buffer continues to exist under its new name. 
This method is also good for mail buffers, compilation buffers, and most
Emacs features that create special buffers with particular names.

   <p><kbd>M-x view-buffer</kbd> is much like <kbd>M-x view-file</kbd> (see <a href="Misc-File-Ops.html#Misc%20File%20Ops">Misc File Ops</a>) except that it examines an already existing Emacs buffer. 
View mode provides commands for scrolling through the buffer
conveniently but not for changing it.  When you exit View mode with
<kbd>q</kbd>, that switches back to the buffer (and the position) which was
previously displayed in the window.  Alternatively, if you exit View
mode with <kbd>e</kbd>, the buffer and the value of point that resulted from
your perusal remain in effect.

   <p>The commands <kbd>M-x append-to-buffer</kbd> and <kbd>M-x insert-buffer</kbd>
can be used to copy text from one buffer to another.  See <a href="Accumulating-Text.html#Accumulating%20Text">Accumulating Text</a>.
