<h3 class="subsection">Left Margin Convention</h4>

<p>In most major modes, Emacs assumes that any opening delimiter found
at the left margin is the start of a top-level definition, or defun. 
Therefore, <strong>never put an opening delimiter at the left margin
unless it should have that significance.</strong>  For instance, never put an
open-parenthesis at the left margin in a Lisp file unless it is the
start of a top-level list.  Never put an open-brace or other opening
delimiter at the beginning of a line of C code unless it is at top
level.

   <p>If you don't follow this convention, not only will you have trouble
when you explicitly use the commands for motion by defuns; other
features that use them will also give you trouble.  This includes
the indentation commands (see <a href="Program-Indent.html#Program%20Indent">Program Indent</a>) and Font Lock
mode (see <a href="Font-Lock.html#Font%20Lock">Font Lock</a>).

   <p>The most likely problem case is when you want an opening delimiter
at the start of a line inside a string.  To avoid trouble, put an
escape character (<code>\</code>, in C and Emacs Lisp, <code>/</code> in some
other Lisp dialects) before the opening delimiter.  This will not
affect the contents of the string, but will prevent that opening
delimiter from starting a defun.  Here's an example:

<pre class="example">       (insert "Foo:
     \(bar)
     ")
     </pre>

   <p>In the earliest days, the original Emacs found defuns by moving
upward a level of parentheses or braces until there were no more
levels to go up.  This always required scanning all the way back to
the beginning of the buffer, even for a small function.  To speed up
the operation, we changed Emacs to assume that any opening delimiter
at the left margin is the start of a defun.  This heuristic is nearly
always right, and avoids the need to scan back to the beginning of the
buffer.  However, it mandates following the convention described
above.
