<h3 class="section">Sentences</h3>

<p>The Emacs commands for manipulating sentences and paragraphs are mostly
on Meta keys, so as to be like the word-handling commands.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-a</kbd>
     <dd>Move back to the beginning of the sentence (<code>backward-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-e</kbd>
     <dd>Move forward to the end of the sentence (<code>forward-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-k</kbd>
     <dd>Kill forward to the end of the sentence (<code>kill-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Kill back to the beginning of the sentence (<code>backward-kill-sentence</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The commands <kbd>M-a</kbd> and <kbd>M-e</kbd> (<code>backward-sentence</code> and
<code>forward-sentence</code>) move to the beginning and end of the current
sentence, respectively.  They were chosen to resemble <kbd>C-a</kbd> and
<kbd>C-e</kbd>, which move to the beginning and end of a line.  Unlike them,
<kbd>M-a</kbd> and <kbd>M-e</kbd> if repeated or given numeric arguments move over
successive sentences.

   <p>Moving backward over a sentence places point just before the first
character of the sentence; moving forward places point right after the
punctuation that ends the sentence.  Neither one moves over the
whitespace at the sentence boundary.

   <p>Just as <kbd>C-a</kbd> and <kbd>C-e</kbd> have a kill command, <kbd>C-k</kbd>, to go
with them, so <kbd>M-a</kbd> and <kbd>M-e</kbd> have a corresponding kill command
<kbd>M-k</kbd> (<code>kill-sentence</code>) which kills from point to the end of
the sentence.  With minus one as an argument it kills back to the
beginning of the sentence.  Larger arguments serve as a repeat count. 
There is also a command, <kbd>C-x &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>
(<code>backward-kill-sentence</code>), for killing back to the beginning of a
sentence.  This command is useful when you change your mind in the
middle of composing text.

   <p>The sentence commands assume that you follow the American typist's
convention of putting two spaces at the end of a sentence; they consider
a sentence to end wherever there is a <code>.</code>, <code>?</code> or <code>!</code>
followed by the end of a line or two spaces, with any number of
<code>)</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>'</code>, or <code>"</code> characters allowed in between. 
A sentence also begins or ends wherever a paragraph begins or ends.

   <p>The variable <code>sentence-end</code> controls recognition of the end of a
sentence.  It is a regexp that matches the last few characters of a
sentence, together with the whitespace following the sentence.  Its
normal value is

<pre class="example">     "[.?!][]\"')]*\\($\\| $\\|\t\\|  \\)[ \t\n]*"
     </pre>

<p>This example is explained in the section on regexps.  See <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>.

   <p>If you want to use just one space between sentences, you should
set <code>sentence-end</code> to this value:

<pre class="example">     "[.?!][]\"')]*\\($\\|\t\\| \\)[ \t\n]*"
     </pre>

<p>You should also set the variable <code>sentence-end-double-space</code> to
<code>nil</code> so that the fill commands expect and leave just one space at
the end of a sentence.  Note that this makes it impossible to
distinguish between periods that end sentences and those that indicate
abbreviations.
