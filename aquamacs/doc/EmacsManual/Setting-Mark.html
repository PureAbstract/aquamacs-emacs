<h3 class="section">Setting the Mark</h3>

<p>Here are some commands for setting the mark:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Set the mark where point is (<code>set-mark-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-@</kbd>
     <dd>The same. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>
     <dd>Interchange mark and point (<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>Drag-Mouse-1</kbd>
     <dd>Set point and the mark around the text you drag across. 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-3</kbd>
     <dd>Set the mark where point is, then move point to where you click
(<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>For example, suppose you wish to convert part of the buffer to
upper case, using the <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd> (<code>upcase-region</code>) command,
which operates on the text in the region.  You can first go to the
beginning of the text to be capitalized, type <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> to put
the mark there, move to the end, and then type <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd>.  Or, you
can set the mark at the end of the text, move to the beginning, and then
type <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd>.

   <p>The most common way to set the mark is with the <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> command
(<code>set-mark-command</code>).  This sets the mark where point is.  Then you
can move point away, leaving the mark behind.

   <p>There are two ways to set the mark with the mouse.  You can drag mouse
button one across a range of text; that puts point where you release the
mouse button, and sets the mark at the other end of that range.  Or you
can click mouse button three, which sets the mark at point (like
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>) and then moves point (like <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>).  Both of
these methods copy the region into the kill ring in addition to setting
the mark; that gives behavior consistent with other window-driven
applications, but if you don't want to modify the kill ring, you must
use keyboard commands to set the mark.  See <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse%20Commands">Mouse Commands</a>.

   <p>Ordinary terminals have only one cursor, so there is no way for Emacs
to show you where the mark is located.  You have to remember.  The usual
solution to this problem is to set the mark and then use it soon, before
you forget where it is.  Alternatively, you can see where the mark is
with the command <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> (<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>) which
puts the mark where point was and point where the mark was.  The extent
of the region is unchanged, but the cursor and point are now at the
previous position of the mark.  In Transient Mark mode, this command
reactivates the mark.

   <p><kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> is also useful when you are satisfied with the position
of point but want to move the other end of the region (where the mark
is); do <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> to put point at that end of the region, and then
move it.  Using <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> a second time, if necessary, puts the mark at
the new position with point back at its original position.

   <p>For more facilities that allow you to go to previously set marks, see
<a href="Mark-Ring.html#Mark%20Ring">Mark Ring</a>.

   <p>There is no such character as <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> in ASCII; when you
type &lt;SPC&gt; while holding down &lt;CTRL&gt;, what you get on most
ordinary terminals is the character <kbd>C-@</kbd>.  This key is actually
bound to <code>set-mark-command</code>.  But unless you are unlucky enough to
have a terminal where typing <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> does not produce
<kbd>C-@</kbd>, you might as well think of this character as
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.  Under X, <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> is actually a distinct
character, but its binding is still <code>set-mark-command</code>.
