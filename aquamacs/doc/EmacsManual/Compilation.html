<h3 class="section">31.1 Running Compilations under Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-inferior-process-2233"></a><a name="index-make-2234"></a><a name="index-compilation-errors-2235"></a><a name="index-error-log-2236"></a>
  Emacs can run compilers for noninteractive languages such as C and
Fortran as inferior processes, feeding the error log into an Emacs buffer. 
It can also parse the error messages and show you the source lines where
compilation errors occurred.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x compile</kbd><dd>Run a compiler asynchronously under Emacs, with error messages going to
the `<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>' buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x recompile</kbd><dd>Invoke a compiler with the same command as in the last invocation of
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-compilation</kbd><dd>Kill the running compilation subprocess. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-compile-2237"></a>  To run <code>make</code> or another compilation command, do <kbd>M-x
compile</kbd>.  This command reads a shell command line using the minibuffer,
and then executes the command in an inferior shell, putting output in
the buffer named `<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>'.  The current buffer's default
directory is used as the working directory for the execution of the
command; normally, therefore, the compilation happens in this
directory.

   <p><a name="index-compile_002dcommand-2238"></a>  The default for the compilation command is normally `<samp><span class="samp">make -k</span></samp>',
which is correct most of the time for nontrivial programs. 
See <a href="../make/index.html#Top">Make</a>.  If you have done <kbd>M-x
compile</kbd> before, the default each time is the command you used the
previous time.  <code>compile</code> stores this command in the variable
<code>compile-command</code>, so setting that variable specifies the default
for the next use of <kbd>M-x compile</kbd>.  If a file specifies a file
local value for <code>compile-command</code>, that provides the default when
you type <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> in that file's buffer.  See <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.

   <p>Starting a compilation displays the buffer `<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>' in
another window but does not select it.  The buffer's mode line tells
you whether compilation is finished, with the word `<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">signal</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">exit</span></samp>' inside the parentheses.  You do not have
to keep this buffer visible; compilation continues in any case.  While
a compilation is going on, the string `<samp><span class="samp">Compiling</span></samp>' appears in the
mode lines of all windows.  When this string disappears, the
compilation is finished.

   <p>If you want to watch the compilation transcript as it appears, switch
to the `<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>' buffer and move point to the end of the
buffer.  When point is at the end, new compilation output is inserted
above point, which remains at the end.  If point is not at the end of
the buffer, it remains fixed while more compilation output is added at
the end of the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-compilation-buffer_002c-keeping-point-at-end-2239"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dscroll_002doutput-2240"></a>  If you change the variable <code>compilation-scroll-output</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, the compilation buffer will scroll automatically
to follow the output as it comes in.  If the value is
<code>first-error</code>, the scrolling stops at the first error that
appears, leaving point at that error.  For any other non-<code>nil</code>
value, the buffer continues scrolling until there is no more output.

   <p><a name="index-recompile-2241"></a>  To rerun the last compilation with the same command, type <kbd>M-x
recompile</kbd>.  This automatically reuses the compilation command from
the last invocation of <kbd>M-x compile</kbd>.  It also reuses the
`<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>' buffer and starts the compilation in its default
directory, which is the directory in which the previous compilation
was started.

   <p>When the compiler process terminates, for whatever reason, the mode
line of the `<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>' buffer changes to say `<samp><span class="samp">exit</span></samp>'
(followed by the exit code, `<samp><span class="samp">[0]</span></samp>' for a normal exit), or
`<samp><span class="samp">signal</span></samp>' (if a signal terminated the process), instead of
`<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>'.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dcompilation-2242"></a>  Starting a new compilation also kills any compilation already
running in `<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>', as the buffer can only handle one
compilation at any time.  However, <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> asks for
confirmation before actually killing a compilation that is running. 
You can also kill the compilation process with <kbd>M-x
kill-compilation</kbd>.

   <p>If you want to run two compilations at once, you should start the
first one, then rename the `<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>' buffer (perhaps using
<code>rename-uniquely</code>; see <a href="Misc-Buffer.html#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>), and start the other
compilation.  That will create a new `<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>' buffer.

   <p>Emacs does not expect a compiler process to launch asynchronous
subprocesses; if it does, and they keep running after the main
compiler process has terminated, Emacs may kill them or their output
may not arrive in Emacs.  To avoid this problem, make the main process
wait for its subprocesses to finish.  In a shell script, you can do this
using `<samp><span class="samp">$!</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">wait</span></samp>', like this:

<pre class="example">     (sleep 10; echo 2nd)&amp; pid=$!  # <span class="roman">Record pid of subprocess</span>
     echo first message
     wait $pid                     # <span class="roman">Wait for subprocess</span>
</pre>
   <p>If the background process does not output to the compilation buffer,
so you only need to prevent it from being killed when the main
compilation process terminates, this is sufficient:

<pre class="example">     nohup <var>command</var>; sleep 1
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-compilation_002denvironment-2243"></a>  You can control the environment passed to the compilation command
with the variable <code>compilation-environment</code>.  Its value is a list
of environment variable settings; each element should be a string of
the form <code>"</code><var>envvarname</var><code>=</code><var>value</var><code>"</code>.  These environment
variable settings override the usual ones.
