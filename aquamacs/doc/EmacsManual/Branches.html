<h3 class="subsection">Multiple Branches of a File</h4>

<p>One use of version control is to maintain multiple "current"
versions of a file.  For example, you might have different versions of a
program in which you are gradually adding various unfinished new
features.  Each such independent line of development is called a
<dfn>branch</dfn>.  VC allows you to create branches, switch between
different branches, and merge changes from one branch to another. 
Please note, however, that branches are only supported for RCS at the
moment.

   <p>A file's main line of development is usually called the <dfn>trunk</dfn>. 
The versions on the trunk are normally numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.  At
any such version, you can start an independent branch.  A branch
starting at version 1.2 would have version number 1.2.1.1, and consecutive
versions on this branch would have numbers 1.2.1.2, 1.2.1.3, 1.2.1.4,
and so on.  If there is a second branch also starting at version 1.2, it
would consist of versions 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2, 1.2.2.3, etc.

   <p>If you omit the final component of a version number, that is called a
<dfn>branch number</dfn>.  It refers to the highest existing version on that
branch--the <dfn>head version</dfn> of that branch.  The branches in the
example above have branch numbers 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.
