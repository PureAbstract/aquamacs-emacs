<h3 class="subsection">Special Diary Entries</h4>

<p>In addition to entries based on calendar dates, the diary file can
contain <dfn>sexp entries</dfn> for regular events such as anniversaries. 
These entries are based on Lisp expressions (sexps) that Emacs evaluates
as it scans the diary file.  Instead of a date, a sexp entry contains
<code>%%</code> followed by a Lisp expression which must begin and end with
parentheses.  The Lisp expression determines which dates the entry
applies to.

   <p>Calendar mode provides commands to insert certain commonly used
sexp entries:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>i a</kbd>
     <dd>Add an anniversary diary entry for the selected date
(<code>insert-anniversary-diary-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i b</kbd>
     <dd>Add a block diary entry for the current region
(<code>insert-block-diary-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i c</kbd>
     <dd>Add a cyclic diary entry starting at the date
(<code>insert-cyclic-diary-entry</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>If you want to make a diary entry that applies to the anniversary of a
specific date, move point to that date and use the <kbd>i a</kbd> command. 
This displays the end of your diary file in another window and inserts
the anniversary description; you can then type the rest of the diary
entry.  The entry looks like this:

<pre class="example">     %%(diary-anniversary 10 31 1948) Arthur's birthday
     </pre>

<p>This entry applies to October 31 in any year after 1948; <code>10 31
1948</code> specifies the date.  (If you are using the European calendar
style, the month and day are interchanged.)  The reason this expression
requires a beginning year is that advanced diary functions can use it to
calculate the number of elapsed years.

   <p>A <dfn>block</dfn> diary entry applies to a specified range of consecutive
dates.  Here is a block diary entry that applies to all dates from June
24, 1990 through July 10, 1990:

<pre class="example">     %%(diary-block 6 24 1990 7 10 1990) Vacation
     </pre>

<p>The <code>6 24 1990</code> indicates the starting date and the <code>7 10 1990</code>
indicates the stopping date.  (Again, if you are using the European calendar
style, the month and day are interchanged.)

   <p>To insert a block entry, place point and the mark on the two
dates that begin and end the range, and type <kbd>i b</kbd>.  This command
displays the end of your diary file in another window and inserts the
block description; you can then type the diary entry.

   <p><dfn>Cyclic</dfn> diary entries repeat after a fixed interval of days.  To
create one, select the starting date and use the <kbd>i c</kbd> command.  The
command prompts for the length of interval, then inserts the entry,
which looks like this:

<pre class="example">     %%(diary-cyclic 50 3 1 1990) Renew medication
     </pre>

<p>This entry applies to March 1, 1990 and every 50th day following;
<code>3 1 1990</code> specifies the starting date.  (If you are using the
European calendar style, the month and day are interchanged.)

   <p>All three of these commands make marking diary entries.  To insert a
nonmarking entry, give a numeric argument to the command.  For example,
<kbd>C-u i a</kbd> makes a nonmarking anniversary diary entry.

   <p>Marking sexp diary entries in the calendar is <em>extremely</em>
time-consuming, since every date visible in the calendar window must be
individually checked.  So it's a good idea to make sexp diary entries
nonmarking (with <code>&amp;</code>) when possible.

   <p>Another sophisticated kind of sexp entry, a <dfn>floating</dfn> diary entry,
specifies a regularly occurring event by offsets specified in days,
weeks, and months.  It is comparable to a crontab entry interpreted by
the <code>cron</code> utility.  Here is a nonmarking, floating diary entry
that applies to the last Thursday in November:

<pre class="example">     &amp;%%(diary-float 11 4 -1) American Thanksgiving
     </pre>

<p>The 11 specifies November (the eleventh month), the 4 specifies Thursday
(the fourth day of the week, where Sunday is numbered zero), and the
-1 specifies "last" (1 would mean "first," 2 would mean
"second," -2 would mean "second-to-last," and so on).  The
month can be a single month or a list of months.  Thus you could change
the 11 above to <code>'(1 2 3)</code> and have the entry apply to the last
Thursday of January, February, and March.  If the month is <code>t</code>, the
entry applies to all months of the year.

   <p>Most generally, sexp diary entries can perform arbitrary
computations to determine when they apply.  See <a href="../elisp/Sexp-Diary-Entries.html#Sexp%20Diary%20Entries">Sexp Diary Entries</a>.
