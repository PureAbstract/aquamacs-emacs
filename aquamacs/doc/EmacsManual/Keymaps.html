<h3 class="subsection">Keymaps</h4>

<p>The bindings between key sequences and command functions are recorded
in data structures called <dfn>keymaps</dfn>.  Emacs has many of these, each
used on particular occasions.

   <p>Recall that a <dfn>key sequence</dfn> (<dfn>key</dfn>, for short) is a sequence
of <dfn>input events</dfn> that have a meaning as a unit.  Input events
include characters, function keys and mouse buttons--all the inputs
that you can send to the computer with your terminal.  A key sequence
gets its meaning from its <dfn>binding</dfn>, which says what command it
runs.  The function of keymaps is to record these bindings.

   <p>The <dfn>global</dfn> keymap is the most important keymap because it is
always in effect.  The global keymap defines keys for Fundamental mode;
most of these definitions are common to most or all major modes.  Each
major or minor mode can have its own keymap which overrides the global
definitions of some keys.

   <p>For example, a self-inserting character such as <kbd>g</kbd> is
self-inserting because the global keymap binds it to the command
<code>self-insert-command</code>.  The standard Emacs editing characters such
as <kbd>C-a</kbd> also get their standard meanings from the global keymap. 
Commands to rebind keys, such as <kbd>M-x global-set-key</kbd>, actually work
by storing the new binding in the proper place in the global map. 
See <a href="Rebinding.html#Rebinding">Rebinding</a>.

   <p>Meta characters work differently; Emacs translates each Meta
character into a pair of characters starting with &lt;ESC&gt;.  When you
type the character <kbd>M-a</kbd> in a key sequence, Emacs replaces it with
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; a</kbd>.  A meta key comes in as a single input event, but
becomes two events for purposes of key bindings.  The reason for this is
historical, and we might change it someday.

   <p>Most modern keyboards have function keys as well as character keys. 
Function keys send input events just as character keys do, and keymaps
can have bindings for them.

   <p>On many terminals, typing a function key actually sends the computer a
sequence of characters; the precise details of the sequence depends on
which function key and on the model of terminal you are using.  (Often
the sequence starts with <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; [</kbd>.)  If Emacs understands your
terminal type properly, it recognizes the character sequences forming
function keys wherever they occur in a key sequence (not just at the
beginning).  Thus, for most purposes, you can pretend the function keys
reach Emacs directly and ignore their encoding as character sequences.

   <p>Mouse buttons also produce input events.  These events come with other
data--the window and position where you pressed or released the button,
and a time stamp.  But only the choice of button matters for key
bindings; the other data matters only if a command looks at it. 
(Commands designed for mouse invocation usually do look at the other
data.)

   <p>A keymap records definitions for single events.  Interpreting a key
sequence of multiple events involves a chain of keymaps.  The first
keymap gives a definition for the first event; this definition is
another keymap, which is used to look up the second event in the
sequence, and so on.

   <p>Key sequences can mix function keys and characters.  For example,
<kbd>C-x &lt;SELECT&gt;</kbd> is meaningful.  If you make &lt;SELECT&gt; a prefix
key, then <kbd>&lt;SELECT&gt; C-n</kbd> makes sense.  You can even mix mouse
events with keyboard events, but we recommend against it, because such
key sequences are inconvenient to use.

   <p>As a user, you can redefine any key; but it is usually best to stick
to key sequences that consist of <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by a letter. 
These keys are "reserved for users," so they won't conflict with any
properly designed Emacs extension.  The function keys &lt;F5&gt; through
&lt;F9&gt; are also reserved for users.  If you redefine some other key,
your definition may be overridden by certain extensions or major modes
which redefine the same key.
