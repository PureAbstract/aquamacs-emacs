<h3 class="section">Major Modes for Programming Languages</h3>

<p>Emacs has specialized major modes for various programming languages. 
See <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major%20Modes">Major Modes</a>.  A programming language major mode typically
specifies the syntax of expressions, the customary rules for
indentation, how to do syntax highlighting for the language, and how
to find the beginning of a function definition.  It often customizes
or provides facilities for compiling and debugging programs as well.

   <p>Ideally, Emacs should provide a major mode for each programming
language that you might want to edit; if it doesn't have a mode for
your favorite language, you can contribute one.  But often the mode
for one language can serve for other syntactically similar languages. 
The major mode for language <var>l</var> is called <code></code><var>l</var><code>-mode</code>,
and you can select it by typing <kbd>M-x </kbd><var>l</var><kbd>-mode &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>. 
See <a href="Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing%20Modes">Choosing Modes</a>.

   <p>The existing programming language major modes include Lisp, Scheme (a
variant of Lisp) and the Scheme-based DSSSL expression language, Ada,
Awk, C, C++, Delphi (Object Pascal), Fortran (free format and fixed
format), Icon, IDL (CORBA), IDLWAVE, Java, Metafont (TeX's
companion for font creation), Modula2, Objective-C, Octave, Pascal,
Perl, Pike, PostScript, Prolog, Simula, Tcl, and VHDL.  There is
also a major mode for makefiles, called Makefile mode.  An alternative
mode for Perl is called CPerl mode.  Modes are available for the
scripting languages of the common GNU and Unix shells, VMS DCL, and
MS-DOS/MS-Windows <code>BAT</code> files.  There are also major modes for
editing various sorts of configuration files.

   <p>In most programming languages, indentation should vary from line to
line to illustrate the structure of the program.  So the major modes
for programming languages arrange for &lt;TAB&gt; to update the
indentation of the current line.  They also rebind &lt;DEL&gt; to treat
a tab as if it were the equivalent number of spaces; this lets you
delete one column of indentation without worrying whether the
whitespace consists of spaces or tabs.  Use <kbd>C-b C-d</kbd> to delete a
tab character before point, in these modes.

   <p>Separate manuals are available for the modes for Ada (see <a href="../ada-mode/index.html#Top">Ada Mode</a>), C/C++/Objective C/Java/Corba IDL
(see <a href="../ccmode/index.html#Top">CC Mode</a>) and the IDLWAVE modes
(see <a href="../idlwave/index.html#Top">IDLWAVE</a>).

   <p>Turning on a major mode runs a normal hook called the <dfn>mode
hook</dfn>, which is the value of a Lisp variable.  Each major mode has a
mode hook, and the hook's name is always made from the mode command's
name by adding <code>-hook</code>.  For example, turning on C mode runs the
hook <code>c-mode-hook</code>, while turning on Lisp mode runs the hook
<code>lisp-mode-hook</code>.  The purpose of the mode hook is to give you a
place to set up customizations for that major mode.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.
