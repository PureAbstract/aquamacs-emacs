<h3 class="subsubsection">Basic Version Control with Locking</h5>

<p>If locking is used for the file (as with SCCS, and RCS in its default
mode), <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> can either lock a file or check it in:

     <ul>
<li>If the file is not locked, <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> locks it, and
makes it writable so that you can change it.

     <li>If the file is locked by you, and contains changes, <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> checks
in the changes.  In order to do this, it first reads the log entry
for the new version.  See <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log%20Buffer">Log Buffer</a>.

     <li>If the file is locked by you, but you have not changed it since you
locked it, <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> releases the lock and makes the file read-only
again.

     <li>If the file is locked by some other user, <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> asks you whether
you want to "steal the lock" from that user.  If you say yes, the file
becomes locked by you, but a message is sent to the person who had
formerly locked the file, to inform him of what has happened. 
</ul>

   <p>These rules also apply when you use CVS in locking mode, except
that there is no such thing as stealing a lock.
