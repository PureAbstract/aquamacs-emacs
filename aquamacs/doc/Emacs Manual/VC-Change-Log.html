<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.5.2 VC Change Log</h5>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v l</kbd><dd>Display revision control state and change history
(<code>vc-print-log</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v L</kbd><dd>Display the change history for the current repository
(<code>vc-print-root-log</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-v-l-2467"></a><a name="index-vc_002dprint_002dlog-2468"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x v l</kbd> (<code>vc-print-log</code>) displays a buffer
named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*vc-change-log*</span></samp>&rsquo; in a new window.  This buffer lists the
changes to the current file, including the associated log entries. 
(These are the log entries associated with the version control system,
i.e. the ones you enter via the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.  See <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>.)  Point is centered at the revision of the file currently
being visited.  With a prefix argument, the command prompts for the
revision to center on, and the maximum number of revisions to display. 
You can call this command from a Dired buffer (see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dprint_002droot_002dlog-2469"></a>  Type <kbd>C-x v L</kbd> (<code>vc-print-root-log</code>) to display a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*vc-change-log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer showing the history of the
version-controlled directory tree as a whole.  With a prefix argument,
the command prompts for the maximum number of revisions to display. 
RCS, SCCS, and CVS do not support this feature.

   <p>In the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*vc-change-log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, you can use the following keys
to move between the logs of revisions and of files, to view past
revisions, to modify change comments, to view annotations and to view
diffs:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Move to the previous revision-item in the buffer.  (Revision entries in the log
buffer are usually in reverse-chronological order, so the previous
revision-item usually corresponds to a newer revision.)  A numeric
prefix argument is a repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Move to the next revision-item (which most often corresponds to the
previous revision of the file).  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat
count.

     <br><dt><kbd>P</kbd><dd>Move to the log of the previous file, when the logs of multiple files
are in the log buffer (see <a href="VC-Directory-Mode.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>).  Otherwise, just
move to the beginning of the log.  A numeric prefix argument is a
repeat count, so <kbd>C-u 10 P</kbd> would move backward 10 files.

     <br><dt><kbd>N</kbd><dd>Move to the log of the next file, when the logs of multiple files are
in the log buffer (see <a href="VC-Directory-Mode.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>).  It also takes a
numeric prefix argument as a repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd>Annotate the revision indicated by the current line.

     <br><dt><kbd>e</kbd><dd>Modify the change comment displayed at point.  Note that not all VC
systems support modifying change comments.

     <br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Visit the revision indicated at the current line, like typing <kbd>C-x
v ~</kbd> and specifying this revision's ID (see <a href="Old-Revisions.html#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>).

     <br><dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Display the diff (see <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>) between the revision
indicated at the current line and the next earlier revision.  This is
useful to see what actually changed in the file when the revision
indicated on the current line was committed.

     <br><dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>Display the changeset diff (see <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>) between the
revision indicated at the current line and the next earlier revision. 
This is useful to see all the changes to all files that the revision
indicated on the current line did when it was committed. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dlog_002dshow_002dlimit-2470"></a>Because fetching many log entries can be slow, the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*vc-change-log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer displays no more than 2000 revisions by
default.  The variable <code>vc-log-show-limit</code> specifies this limit;
if you set the value to zero, that removes the limit.  You can also
increase the number of revisions shown in an existing
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*vc-change-log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer by clicking on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Show 2X
entries</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Show unlimited entries</span></samp>&rsquo; buttons at the end of the
buffer.  However, RCS, SCCS, and CVS do not support this feature.
