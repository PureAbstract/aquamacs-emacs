<h2 class="chapter">55 Dissociated Press</h2>

<p><a name="index-dissociated_002dpress-3851"></a>  <kbd>M-x dissociated-press</kbd> is a command for scrambling a file of text
either word by word or character by character.  Starting from a buffer of
straight English, it produces extremely amusing output.  The input comes
from the current Emacs buffer.  Dissociated Press writes its output in a
buffer named `<samp><span class="samp">*Dissociation*</span></samp>', and redisplays that buffer after every
couple of lines (approximately) so you can read the output as it comes out.

   <p>Dissociated Press asks every so often whether to continue generating
output.  Answer <kbd>n</kbd> to stop it.  You can also stop at any time by
typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  The dissociation output remains in the
`<samp><span class="samp">*Dissociation*</span></samp>' buffer for you to copy elsewhere if you wish.

   <p><a name="index-presidentagon-3852"></a>  Dissociated Press operates by jumping at random from one point in
the buffer to another.  In order to produce plausible output rather
than gibberish, it insists on a certain amount of overlap between the
end of one run of consecutive words or characters and the start of the
next.  That is, if it has just output `president' and then decides to
jump to a different point in the buffer, it might spot the `ent' in
`pentagon' and continue from there, producing `presidentagon'.  Long
sample texts produce the best results.

   <p><a name="index-againformation-3853"></a>  A positive argument to <kbd>M-x dissociated-press</kbd> tells it to operate
character by character, and specifies the number of overlap characters.  A
negative argument tells it to operate word by word, and specifies the number
of overlap words.  In this mode, whole words are treated as the elements to
be permuted, rather than characters.  No argument is equivalent to an
argument of two.  For your againformation, the output goes only into the
buffer `<samp><span class="samp">*Dissociation*</span></samp>'.  The buffer you start with is not changed.

   <p><a name="index-Markov-chain-3854"></a><a name="index-ignoriginal-3855"></a><a name="index-techniquitous-3856"></a>  Dissociated Press produces results fairly like those of a Markov
chain based on a frequency table constructed from the sample text.  It
is, however, an independent, ignoriginal invention.  Dissociated Press
techniquitously copies several consecutive characters from the sample
text between random jumps, unlike a Markov chain which would jump
randomly after each word or character.  This makes for more plausible
sounding results, and runs faster.

   <p><a name="index-outragedy-3857"></a><a name="index-buggestion-3858"></a><a name="index-properbose-3859"></a><a name="index-mustatement-3860"></a><a name="index-developediment-3861"></a><a name="index-userenced-3862"></a>  It is a mustatement that too much use of Dissociated Press can be a
developediment to your real work, sometimes to the point of outragedy. 
And keep dissociwords out of your documentation, if you want it to be well
userenced and properbose.  Have fun.  Your buggestions are welcome.
