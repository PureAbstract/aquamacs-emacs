<h3 class="section">29.4 Pages</h3>

<p><a name="index-pages-1572"></a><a name="index-formfeed-character-1573"></a>  Within some text files, text is divided into <dfn>pages</dfn>, which are
delimited by the <dfn>formfeed character</dfn> (<acronym>ASCII</acronym> code 12,
sometimes denoted as &lt;control-L&gt;).  When you print hardcopy for a
file, the formfeed character forces a page break: each page of the
file goes on a separate page on paper.  Most Emacs commands treat the
formfeed character just like any other character: you can insert it
with <kbd>C-q C-l</kbd>, and delete it with &lt;DEL&gt;.  However, since
pages are often meaningful divisions of the file, Emacs provides
commands to move over them and operate on them.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x [</kbd><dd>Move point to previous page boundary (<code>backward-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x ]</kbd><dd>Move point to next page boundary (<code>forward-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-p</kbd><dd>Put point and mark around this page (or another page) (<code>mark-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x l</kbd><dd>Count the lines in this page (<code>count-lines-page</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-_005b-1574"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-_005d-1575"></a><a name="index-forward_002dpage-1576"></a><a name="index-backward_002dpage-1577"></a>  The <kbd>C-x [</kbd> (<code>backward-page</code>) command moves point to immediately
after the previous page delimiter.  If point is already right after a page
delimiter, it skips that one and stops at the previous one.  A numeric
argument serves as a repeat count.  The <kbd>C-x ]</kbd> (<code>forward-page</code>)
command moves forward past the next page delimiter.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dp-1578"></a><a name="index-mark_002dpage-1579"></a>  The <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> command (<code>mark-page</code>) puts point at the
beginning of the current page and the mark at the end.  The page
delimiter at the end is included (the mark follows it).  The page
delimiter at the front is excluded (point follows it).

   <p><kbd>C-x C-p C-w</kbd> is a handy way to kill a page to move it
elsewhere.  If you move to another page delimiter with <kbd>C-x [</kbd> and
<kbd>C-x ]</kbd>, then yank the killed page, all the pages will be properly
delimited once again.  The reason <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> includes only the
following page delimiter in the region is to ensure that.

   <p>A numeric argument to <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> specifies which page to go to,
relative to the current one.  Zero means the current page.  One means
the next page, and &minus;1 means the previous one.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-l-1580"></a><a name="index-count_002dlines_002dpage-1581"></a>  The <kbd>C-x l</kbd> command (<code>count-lines-page</code>) is good for deciding
where to break a page in two.  It displays in the echo area the total number
of lines in the current page, and then divides it up into those preceding
the current line and those following, as in

<pre class="example">     Page has 96 (72+25) lines
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice that the sum is off by one; this is correct if point is not at the
beginning of a line.

   <p><a name="index-page_002ddelimiter-1582"></a>  The variable <code>page-delimiter</code> controls where pages begin.  Its
value is a regular expression that matches the beginning of a line
that separates pages (see <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  The normal value of this
variable is <code>"^\f"</code>, which matches a formfeed character at the
beginning of a line.
