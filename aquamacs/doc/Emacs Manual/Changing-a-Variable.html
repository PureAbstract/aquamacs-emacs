<h4 class="subsection">57.2.3 Changing a Variable</h4>

<p>Here is an example of what a variable (a user option) looks like in
the customization buffer:

<pre class="smallexample">     Kill Ring Max: [Hide Value] 60
        [State]: STANDARD.
     Maximum length of kill ring before oldest elements are thrown away.
</pre>
   <p>The text following `<samp><span class="samp">[Hide Value]</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">60</span></samp>' in this case, indicates
the current value of the variable.  If you see `<samp><span class="samp">[Show Value]</span></samp>' instead of
`<samp><span class="samp">[Hide Value]</span></samp>', it means that the value is hidden; the customization
buffer initially hides values that take up several lines.  Invoke
`<samp><span class="samp">[Show Value]</span></samp>' to show the value.

   <p>The line after the variable name indicates the <dfn>customization
state</dfn> of the variable: in the example above, it says you have not
changed the option yet.  The `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' button at the beginning of
this line gives you a menu of various operations for customizing the
variable.

   <p>The line after the `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' line displays the beginning of the
variable's documentation string.  If there are more lines of
documentation, this line ends with a `<samp><span class="samp">[More]</span></samp>' button; invoke that
to show the full documentation string.

   <p>To enter a new value for `<samp><span class="samp">Kill Ring Max</span></samp>', move point to the
value and edit it textually.  For example, you can type <kbd>M-d</kbd>,
then insert another number.  As you begin to alter the text, you will
see the `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' line change to say that you have edited the
value:

<pre class="smallexample">     [State]: EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or <span class="roman">...</span>
                                                                save it.
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-user-options_002c-how-to-set-3915"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-how-to-set-3916"></a><a name="index-settings_002c-how-to-set-3917"></a>  Editing the value does not actually set the variable.  To do that,
you must <dfn>set</dfn> the variable.  To do this, invoke the
`<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' button and choose `<samp><span class="samp">Set for Current Session</span></samp>'.

   <p>The state of the variable changes visibly when you set it:

<pre class="smallexample">     [State]: SET for current session only.
</pre>
   <p>You don't have to worry about specifying a value that is not valid;
the `<samp><span class="samp">Set for Current Session</span></samp>' operation checks for validity and
will not install an unacceptable value.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dTAB-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-3918"></a><a name="index-widget_002dcomplete-3919"></a>  While editing a field that is a file name, directory name,
command name, or anything else for which completion is defined, you
can type <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>widget-complete</code>) to do completion. 
(<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> do the same thing.)

   <p>Some variables have a small fixed set of possible legitimate values. 
These variables don't let you edit the value textually.  Instead, a
`<samp><span class="samp">[Value Menu]</span></samp>' button appears before the value; invoke this
button to change the value.  For a boolean &ldquo;on or off&rdquo; value, the
button says `<samp><span class="samp">[Toggle]</span></samp>', and it changes to the other value. 
`<samp><span class="samp">[Value Menu]</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">[Toggle]</span></samp>' simply edit the buffer; the
changes take real effect when you use the `<samp><span class="samp">Set for Current
Session</span></samp>' operation.

   <p>Some variables have values with complex structure.  For example, the
value of <code>file-coding-system-alist</code> is an association list.  Here
is how it appears in the customization buffer:

<pre class="smallexample">     File Coding System Alist: [Hide Value]
     [INS] [DEL] File regexp: \.elc\'
                 Choice: [Value Menu] Encoding/decoding pair:
                 Decoding: emacs-mule
                 Encoding: emacs-mule
     [INS] [DEL] File regexp: \(\`\|/\)loaddefs.el\'
                 Choice: [Value Menu] Encoding/decoding pair:
                 Decoding: raw-text
                 Encoding: raw-text-unix
     [INS] [DEL] File regexp: \.tar\'
                 Choice: [Value Menu] Encoding/decoding pair:
                 Decoding: no-conversion
                 Encoding: no-conversion
     [INS] [DEL] File regexp:
                 Choice: [Value Menu] Encoding/decoding pair:
                 Decoding: undecided
                 Encoding: nil
     [INS]
        [State]: STANDARD.
     Alist to decide a coding system to use for a file I/O <span class="roman">...</span>
                                     operation. [Hide Rest]
     The format is ((PATTERN . VAL) ...),
     where PATTERN is a regular expression matching a file name,
     <span class="roman">[...more lines of documentation...]</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Each association in the list appears on four lines, with several
editable fields and/or buttons.  You can edit the regexps and coding
systems using ordinary editing commands.  You can also invoke
`<samp><span class="samp">[Value Menu]</span></samp>' to switch to a different kind of value&mdash;for
instance, to specify a function instead of a pair of coding systems.

   <p>To delete an association from the list, invoke the `<samp><span class="samp">[DEL]</span></samp>' button
for that item.  To add an association, invoke `<samp><span class="samp">[INS]</span></samp>' at the
position where you want to add it.  There is an `<samp><span class="samp">[INS]</span></samp>' button
between each pair of associations, another at the beginning and another
at the end, so you can add a new association at any position in the
list.

   <p><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-3920"></a><a name="index-S_002dTAB-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-3921"></a><a name="index-widget_002dforward-3922"></a><a name="index-widget_002dbackward-3923"></a>  Two special commands, &lt;TAB&gt; and <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>, are useful
for moving through the customization buffer.  &lt;TAB&gt;
(<code>widget-forward</code>) moves forward to the next button or editable
field; <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>widget-backward</code>) moves backward to
the previous button or editable field.

   <p>Typing &lt;RET&gt; on an editable field also moves forward, just like
&lt;TAB&gt;.  You can thus type &lt;RET&gt; when you are finished editing
a field, to move on to the next button or field.  To insert a newline
within an editable field, use <kbd>C-o</kbd> or <kbd>C-q C-j</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-saving-a-setting-3924"></a><a name="index-settings_002c-how-to-save-3925"></a>  Setting the variable changes its value in the current Emacs session;
<dfn>saving</dfn> the value changes it for future sessions as well.  To
save the variable, invoke `<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' and select the `<samp><span class="samp">Save for
Future Sessions</span></samp>' operation.  This works by writing code so as to set
the variable again, each time you start Emacs (see <a href="Saving-Customizations.html#Saving-Customizations">Saving Customizations</a>).

   <p>You can also restore the variable to its standard value by invoking
`<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' and selecting the `<samp><span class="samp">Erase Customization</span></samp>' operation. 
There are actually four reset operations:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Undo Edits</span></samp>'<dd>If you have made some modifications and not yet set the variable,
this restores the text in the customization buffer to match
the actual value.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Reset to Saved</span></samp>'<dd>This restores the value of the variable to the last saved value,
and updates the text accordingly.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Erase Customization</span></samp>'<dd>This sets the variable to its standard value, and updates the text
accordingly.  This also eliminates any saved value for the variable,
so that you will get the standard value in future Emacs sessions.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">Set to Backup Value</span></samp>'<dd>This sets the variable to a previous value that was set in the
customization buffer in this session.  If you customize a variable
and then reset it, which discards the customized value,
you can get the discarded value back again with this operation. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-comments-on-customized-settings-3926"></a>  Sometimes it is useful to record a comment about a specific
customization.  Use the `<samp><span class="samp">Add Comment</span></samp>' item from the
`<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>' menu to create a field for entering the comment.  The
comment you enter will be saved, and displayed again if you again view
the same variable in a customization buffer, even in another session.

   <p>The state of a group indicates whether anything in that group has been
edited, set or saved.

   <p>Near the top of the customization buffer there are two lines of buttons:

<pre class="smallexample">      [Set for Current Session] [Save for Future Sessions]
      [Undo Edits] [Reset to Saved] [Erase Customization]   [Finish]
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-custom_002dbuffer_002ddone_002dfunction-3927"></a>Invoking `<samp><span class="samp">[Finish]</span></samp>' either buries or kills this customization
buffer according to the setting of the option
<code>custom-buffer-done-kill</code>; the default is to bury the buffer. 
Each of the other buttons performs an operation&mdash;set, save or
reset&mdash;on each of the settings in the buffer that could meaningfully
be set, saved or reset.  They do not operate on settings whose values
are hidden, nor on subgroups which are hidden or not visible in the buffer.
