<h4 class="subsection">29.13.9 Conversion Between Plain Text and Tables</h4>

<p><a name="index-text-to-table-1918"></a><a name="index-table-to-text-1919"></a>
<a name="index-table_002dcapture-1920"></a>  The command <code>table-capture</code> captures plain text in a region and
turns it into a table.  Unlike <code>table-recognize</code> (see <a href="Table-Recognition.html#Table-Recognition">Table Recognition</a>), the original text does not have a table appearance but
may hold a logical table structure.  For example, some elements
separated by known patterns form a two dimensional structure which can
be turned into a table.

   <p>Here's an example of data that <code>table-capture</code> can operate on. 
The numbers are horizontally separated by a comma and vertically
separated by a newline character.

<pre class="example">     1, 2, 3, 4
     5, 6, 7, 8
     , 9, 10
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Invoking <kbd>M-x table-capture</kbd> on that text produces this table:

<pre class="example">     +-----+-----+-----+-----+
     |1    |2    |3    |4    |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+
     |5    |6    |7    |8    |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+
     |     |9    |10   |     |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The conversion uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; for the column delimiter and newline for
a row delimiter, cells are left justified, and minimum cell width is
5.

   <p><a name="index-table_002drelease-1921"></a>  The command <code>table-release</code> does the opposite of
<code>table-capture</code>.  It releases a table by removing the table frame
and cell borders.  This leaves the table contents as plain text.  One
of the useful applications of <code>table-capture</code> and
<code>table-release</code> is to edit a text in layout.  Look at the
following three paragraphs (the latter two are indented with header
lines):

<pre class="example">     &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">table-capture</span></samp>&rsquo; is a powerful command, but mastering its
     power requires some practice.  Here are some things it can do:
     
     Parse Cell Items      By using column delimiter regular
                           expression and raw delimiter regular
                           expression, it parses the specified text
                           area and extracts cell items from
                           non-table text and then forms a table out
                           of them.
     
     Capture Text Area     When no delimiters are specified it
                           creates a single cell table.  The text in
                           the specified region is placed in that
                           cell.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Applying <code>table-capture</code> to a region containing the above three
paragraphs, with empty strings for column delimiter regexp and row
delimiter regexp, creates a table with a single cell like the
following one.

   <p class="noindent">By splitting the cell appropriately we now have a table consisting of
paragraphs occupying its own cell.  Each cell can now be edited
independently without affecting the layout of other cells.

   <p class="noindent">By applying <code>table-release</code>, which does the opposite process, the
contents become once again plain text.  <code>table-release</code> works as
a companion command to <code>table-capture</code>.
