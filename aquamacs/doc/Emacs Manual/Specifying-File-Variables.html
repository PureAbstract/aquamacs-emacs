<h5 class="subsubsection">57.3.4.1 Specifying File Variables</h5>

<p>There are two ways to specify file local variable values: in the first
line, or with a local variables list.  Here's how to specify them in the
first line:

<pre class="example">     -*- mode: <var>modename</var>; <var>var</var>: <var>value</var>; ... -*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can specify any number of variables/value pairs in this way, each
pair with a colon and semicolon as shown above.  <code>mode:
</code><var>modename</var><code>;</code> specifies the major mode; this should come first in the
line.  The <var>value</var>s are not evaluated; they are used literally. 
Here is an example that specifies Lisp mode and sets two variables with
numeric values:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;; -*- mode: Lisp; fill-column: 75; comment-column: 50; -*-
</pre>
   <p>You can also specify the coding system for a file in this way: just
specify a value for the &ldquo;variable&rdquo; named <code>coding</code>.  The &ldquo;value&rdquo;
must be a coding system name that Emacs recognizes.  See <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.  `<samp><span class="samp">unibyte:&nbsp;t</span></samp>'<!-- /@w --> specifies unibyte loading for a
particular Lisp file.  See <a href="Enabling-Multibyte.html#Enabling-Multibyte">Enabling Multibyte</a>.

   <p>The <code>eval</code> pseudo-variable, described below, can be specified in
the first line as well.

   <p><a name="index-shell-scripts_002c-and-local-file-variables-3968"></a><a name="index-man-pages_002c-and-local-file-variables-3969"></a>  In shell scripts, the first line is used to identify the script
interpreter, so you cannot put any local variables there.  To
accommodate this, Emacs looks for local variable specifications in the
<em>second</em> line when the first line specifies an interpreter. 
The same is true for man pages which start with the magic string
`<samp><span class="samp">'\"</span></samp>' to specify a list of troff preprocessors (not all do,
however).

   <p>A <dfn>local variables list</dfn> goes near the end of the file.  It
starts with a line containing the string `<samp><span class="samp">Local Variables:</span></samp>', and
ends with a line containing the string `<samp><span class="samp">End:</span></samp>'.  In between come
the variable names and values, one set per line, as
`<samp><var>variable</var><span class="samp">: </span><var>value</var></samp>'.  The <var>value</var>s are not
evaluated; they are used literally.  If a file has both a local
variables list and a `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>' line, Emacs processes
<em>everything</em> in the `<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>' line first, and <em>everything</em>
in the local variables list afterward.

   <p>Here is an example of a local variables list:

<pre class="example">     /* Local Variables: */
     /* mode:c           */
     /* comment-column:0 */
     /* End:             */
</pre>
   <p>In this example, each line starts with the prefix `<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>' and each
line ends with the suffix `<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>'.  Emacs recognizes these as the
prefix and suffix by finding them surrounding the magic string
`<samp><span class="samp">Local Variables:</span></samp>', on the first line of the list; it then
automatically discards them from the other lines of the list.

   <p>The usual reason for using a prefix and/or suffix is to embed the
local variables list in a comment, so it won't confuse other programs
that the file is intended as input for.  The example above is for the
C programming language, where comment lines start with `<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>' and
end with `<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>'.  Don't use a prefix (or a suffix) if you don't
need one.

   <p>If you write a multi-line string value, you should put the prefix
and suffix on each line, even lines that start or end within the
string.  They will be stripped off for processing the list.  If you
want to split a long string across multiple lines of the file, you can
use backslash-newline, which is ignored in Lisp string constants. 
Here's an example of doing this:

<pre class="example">     # Local Variables:
     # compile-command: "cc foo.c -Dfoo=bar -Dhack=whatever \
     #   -Dmumble=blaah"
     # End:
</pre>
   <p>Some &ldquo;variable names&rdquo; have special meanings in a local variables
list.  Specifying the &ldquo;variable&rdquo; <code>mode</code> really sets the major
mode, while any value specified for the &ldquo;variable&rdquo; <code>eval</code> is
simply evaluated as an expression (its value is ignored).  A value for
<code>coding</code> specifies the coding system for character code
conversion of this file, and a value of <code>t</code> for <code>unibyte</code>
says to visit the file in a unibyte buffer.  These four &ldquo;variables&rdquo;
are not really variables; setting them in any other context has no
special meaning.

   <p><em>If </em><code>mode</code><em> is used to set a major mode, it should be the
first &ldquo;variable&rdquo; in the list.</em>  Otherwise, the entries that precede
it will usually be ignored, since most modes kill all local variables
as part of their initialization.

   <p>You can use the <code>mode</code> &ldquo;variable&rdquo; to set minor modes as well
as the major modes; in fact, you can use it more than once, first to
set the major mode and then to set minor modes which are specific to
particular buffers.  But most minor modes should not be specified in
the file at all, because they represent user preferences.

   <p>For example, you may be tempted to try to turn on Auto Fill mode with
a local variable list.  That is a mistake.  The choice of Auto Fill mode
or not is a matter of individual taste, not a matter of the contents of
particular files.  If you want to use Auto Fill, set up major mode hooks
with your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file to turn it on (when appropriate) for you
alone (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  Don't use a local variable list to impose
your taste on everyone.

   <p>The start of the local variables list must be no more than 3000
characters from the end of the file, and must be in the last page if
the file is divided into pages.  Otherwise, Emacs will not notice it
is there.  The purpose of this rule is so that Emacs need not take the
time to search the whole file.

   <p>Use the command <code>normal-mode</code> to reset the local variables and
major mode of a buffer according to the file name and contents,
including the local variables list if any.  See <a href="Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>.
