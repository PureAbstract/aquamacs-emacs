  Sometimes, you may come across &ldquo;unfilled&rdquo; text files, which Emacs
normally displays as a bunch of extremely long lines.  Comfortably
reading and editing such files normally requires &ldquo;word wrap&rdquo;, a
feature that breaks up each long text line into multiple screen lines
in a readable manner&mdash;by putting the breaks at word boundaries.  Many
text editors, such as those built into many web browsers, perform word
wrapping by default.

   <p>There are two different minor modes in Emacs that perform word
wrapping.  The first is Visual Line mode, which does it by altering
the behavior of screen line continuation.  See <a href="Visual-Line-Mode.html#Visual-Line-Mode">Visual Line Mode</a>,
for information about Visual Line mode.

   <p><a name="index-longlines_002dmode-1618"></a>  Instead of using Visual Line mode, you can use a minor mode called
Long Lines mode.  Long Lines mode wraps lines by inserting or deleting
<dfn>soft newlines</dfn> as you type (see <a href="Hard-and-Soft-Newlines.html#Hard-and-Soft-Newlines">Hard and Soft Newlines</a>). 
These soft newlines won't show up when you save the buffer into a
file, or when you copy the text into the kill ring, clipboard, or a
register.  Unlike Visual Line mode, Lone Lines mode breaks long lines
at the fill column (see <a href="Fill-Commands.html#Fill-Commands">Fill Commands</a>), rather than the right
window edge.  To enable Long Lines mode, type <kbd>M-x
longlines-mode</kbd>.  If the text is full of long lines, this also
immediately &ldquo;wraps&rdquo; them all.

   <p><a name="index-longlines_002dauto_002dwrap-1619"></a>  The word wrap performed by Long Lines mode is <em>not</em> the same as
ordinary filling (see <a href="Fill-Commands.html#Fill-Commands">Fill Commands</a>).  It does not contract
multiple spaces into a single space, recognize fill prefixes
(see <a href="Fill-Prefix.html#Fill-Prefix">Fill Prefix</a>), or perform adaptive filling (see <a href="Adaptive-Fill.html#Adaptive-Fill">Adaptive Fill</a>).  The reason for this is that a wrapped line is still,
conceptually, a single line.  Each soft newline is equivalent to
exactly one space in that long line, and vice versa.  However, you can
still call filling functions such as <kbd>M-q</kbd>, and these will work as
expected, inserting soft newlines that won't show up on disk or when
the text is copied.  You can even rely entirely on the normal fill
commands by turning off automatic line wrapping, with <kbd>C-u M-x
longlines-auto-wrap</kbd>.  To turn automatic line wrapping back on, type
<kbd>M-x longlines-auto-wrap</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-longlines_002dshow_002dhard_002dnewlines-1620"></a>  Type <kbd>RET</kbd> to insert a hard newline, one which automatic
refilling will not remove.  If you want to see where all the hard
newlines are, type <kbd>M-x longlines-show-hard-newlines</kbd>.  This will
mark each hard newline with a special symbol.  The same command with a
prefix argument turns this display off.

   <p>Long Lines mode does not change normal text files that are already
filled, since the existing newlines are considered hard newlines. 
Before Long Lines can do anything, you need to transform each
paragraph into a long line.  One way is to set <code>fill-column</code> to a
large number (e.g., <kbd>C-u 9999 C-x f</kbd>), re-fill all the paragraphs,
and then set <code>fill-column</code> back to its original value.
