<h3 class="section">F.1 Basic Emacs usage under Mac OS and GNUstep</h3>

<p>By default, the &lt;alt&gt; and &lt;option&gt; keys are the same as
&lt;Meta&gt; when running under Mac OS.  The Mac &lt;Cmd&gt; key is the
same as &lt;Super&gt;, and Emacs provides a set of keybindings using
this modifier key that mimic other Mac / GNUstep applications (see <a href="Mac-_002f-GNUstep-Events.html#Mac-_002f-GNUstep-Events">Mac / GNUstep Events</a>).  You can change these bindings in the usual way (see <a href="Key-Bindings.html#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>).

   <p>The standard Mac / GNUstep font and color panels are accessible via Lisp commands. 
  To use the color panel, drag from it to an Emacs frame to change the
foreground color of the face at that position (if the &lt;shift&gt; key
is held down, it changes the background color instead). To discard the
settings, create a new frame and close the altered one. 
<!-- [unclear if the following holds.] -->
<!-- To finalize the settings for either color or font, choose @samp{Save Options} in the @samp{Options} menu. -->

   <p>&lt;S-Mouse-1&gt; (i.e., clicking the left mouse button
while holding down the &lt;Shift&gt; key) adjusts the region to the
click position, just like &lt;Mouse-3&gt; (<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>);
it does not pop up a menu for changing the default face, as
&lt;S-Mouse-1&gt; normally does (see <a href="Temporary-Face-Changes.html#Temporary-Face-Changes">Temporary Face Changes</a>).  This
change makes Emacs behave more like other Mac / GNUstep applications.

   <p>When you open or save files using the menus, or using the
&lt;Cmd-o&gt; and &lt;Cmd-S&gt; bindings, Emacs uses graphical file
dialogs to read file names.  However, if you use the regular Emacs key
sequences, such as &lt;C-x C-f&gt;, Emacs uses the minibuffer to read
file names.

   <p>On GNUstep, in an X-windows environment you need to use &lt;Cmd-c&gt;
instead of one of the &lt;C-w&gt; or &lt;M-w&gt; commands to transfer text
to the X primary selection; otherwise, Emacs will use the
&ldquo;clipboard&rdquo; selection.  Likewise, &lt;Cmd-y&gt; (instead of &lt;C-y&gt;)
yanks from the X primary selection instead of the kill-ring or
clipboard.

<h4 class="subsection">F.1.1 Grabbing environment variables</h4>

<!-- How is this any different to launching from a window manager menu -->
<!-- in GNU/Linux?  These are sometimes not login shells either. -->
<p>Many programs which may run under Emacs, like latex or man, depend on the
settings of environment variables.  If Emacs is launched from the shell, it
will automatically inherit these environment variables and its subprocesses
will inherit them from it.  But if Emacs is launched from the Finder it
is not a descendant of any shell, so its environment variables haven't been
set, which often causes the subprocesses it launches to behave differently than
they would when launched from the shell.

   <p>For the PATH and MANPATH variables, a system-wide method
of setting PATH is recommended on Mac OS X 10.5 and later, using the
<samp><span class="file">/etc/paths</span></samp> files and the <samp><span class="file">/etc/paths.d</span></samp> directory.
