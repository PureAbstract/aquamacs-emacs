<h2 class="unnumbered">Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Many people have contributed code included in the Free Software
Foundation's distribution of GNU Emacs.  To show our appreciation for
their public spirit, we list here in alphabetical order those who have
written substantial portions.  Others too numerous to mention have
reported and fixed bugs, and added features to many parts of Emacs. 
We thank them for their generosity as well.

   <p>This list is intended to mention every contributor of a major package or
feature we currently distribute; if you know of someone we have omitted,
please report that as a manual bug.  More comprehensive information is
available in the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> files, summarized in the file
<samp><span class="file">etc/AUTHORS</span></samp> in the distribution.

<!-- We should list here anyone who has contributed a new package, -->
<!-- and anyone who has made major enhancements in Emacs -->
<!-- that many users would notice and consider important. -->
<!-- Remove things that are no longer distributed. -->
<!-- Note this file is only used ifnottex; otherwise a shorter version in -->
<!-- emacs.texi is used. -->
