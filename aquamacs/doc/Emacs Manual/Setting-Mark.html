<h3 class="section">11.1 Setting the Mark</h3>

<p>Here are some commands for setting the mark:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, and activate it (<code>set-mark-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-@</kbd><dd>The same. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-x</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, and move point where the mark was
(<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>Drag-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Set point and the mark around the text you drag across. 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-3</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, then move point to where you click
(<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lsquo;</kbd><samp><span class="samp">Shifted motion keys</span></samp><kbd>&rsquo;</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point if the mark is inactive, then move point. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dSPC-301"></a><a name="index-C_002d_0040_0040-302"></a><a name="index-set_002dmark_002dcommand-303"></a>  The most common way to set the mark is with <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>set-mark-command</code>)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  This sets the mark where point is,
and activates it.  You can then move point away, leaving the mark
behind.

   <p>For example, suppose you wish to convert part of the buffer to upper
case.  To accomplish this, go to the beginning of the desired text,
type <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, and move point until the desired portion of
text is highlighted.  Now type <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd> (<code>upcase-region</code>). 
This converts the text in the region to upper case, and then
deactivates the mark.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dx-304"></a><a name="index-exchange_002dpoint_002dand_002dmark-305"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> (<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>) exchanges
the positions of point and the mark, keeping the region unchanged.  If
the mark is inactive, Emacs first reactivates the mark wherever it was
last set.  <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> is useful when you are satisfied with the
position of point but want to move the other end of the region (where
the mark is).  Using <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> a second time, if necessary, puts
the mark at the new position with point back at its original position.

   <p>You can also set the mark with the mouse.  If you press the left
mouse button (<kbd>down-mouse-1</kbd>) and drag the mouse across a range of
text while holding down this button, this sets the mark where you
first pressed the mouse button and puts point where you release it. 
Alternatively, clicking the right mouse button (<kbd>mouse-3</kbd>) sets
the mark at point and then moves point to where you clicked.  Using
the mouse to mark a region also copies the region into the kill ring
(see <a href="Kill-Ring.html#Kill-Ring">Kill Ring</a>).  See <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>, for a more detailed
description of these mouse commands.

   <p><a name="index-shift_002dselection-306"></a>  Finally, you can set the mark by holding down the shift key while
typing certain cursor motion commands (such as <kbd>S-&lt;right&gt;</kbd>,
<kbd>S-C-f</kbd>, <kbd>S-C-n</kbd>, etc.)  This is referred to as
<dfn>shift-selection</dfn>.  This sets the mark at point before moving
point, but only if there is no active mark set via shift-selection. 
The mark set by mouse commands and by shift-selection behaves slightly
differently from the usual mark: any subsequent unshifted cursor
motion command deactivates it automatically.  For details, See <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>.

   <p>Whenever the mark is active, you can deactivate it by typing
<kbd>C-g</kbd> (see <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>).  The mark is also automatically
deactivated after certain non-motion commands.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> There is no <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
character in <acronym>ASCII</acronym>; usually, typing <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> on a
text terminal gives the character <kbd>C-@</kbd>.  This key is also bound
to <code>set-mark-command</code>, so unless you are unlucky enough to have
a text terminal that behaves differently, you might as well think of
<kbd>C-@</kbd> as <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.</p>
