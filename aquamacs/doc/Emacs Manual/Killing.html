<h2 class="chapter">12 Killing and Moving Text</h2>

<p><dfn>Killing</dfn> means erasing text and copying it into the <dfn>kill
ring</dfn>, from which you can bring it back into the buffer by
<dfn>yanking</dfn> it.  (Some applications use the terms &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pasting&rdquo; for similar operations.)  This is the most common way of
moving or copying text within Emacs.  It is very versatile, because
there are commands for killing many different types of syntactic
units.

   <p><a name="index-killing-text-334"></a><a name="index-cutting-text-335"></a><a name="index-deletion-336"></a>  Most commands which erase text from the buffer save it in the kill
ring.  These are known as <dfn>kill</dfn> commands.  The kill ring stores
several recent kills, not just the last one, so killing is a very safe
operation: when you make a new kill, you don't have to worry much
about losing text that you previously killed.

   <p>You can yank text from the kill ring into any position in a buffer,
including a position in a different buffer; the kill ring is shared by
all buffers.  The <kbd>C-/</kbd> (<code>undo</code>) command can undo both kill
and delete commands (see <a href="Undo.html#Undo">Undo</a>); the importance of the kill ring is
that you can yank the text in a different place.

   <p>Commands that erase text but do not save it in the kill ring are
known as <dfn>delete</dfn> commands.  These include <kbd>C-d</kbd>
(<code>delete-char</code>) and &lt;DEL&gt; (<code>delete-backward-char</code>),
which delete only one character at a time, and those commands that
delete only spaces or newlines.  Commands that can erase significant
amounts of nontrivial data generally do a kill operation instead.  The
commands' names and individual descriptions use the words &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">kill</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">delete</span></samp>&rsquo; to say which kind of operation they perform.

   <p>You can also use the mouse to kill and yank.  See <a href="Cut-and-Paste.html#Cut-and-Paste">Cut and Paste</a>.
