   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dq-1075"></a><a name="index-buffer_002dread_002donly-1076"></a><a name="index-read_002donly-buffer-1077"></a>  A buffer can be <dfn>read-only</dfn>, which means that commands to change
its contents are not allowed.  The mode line indicates read-only
buffers with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%*</span></samp>&rsquo; near the left margin.  Read-only
buffers are usually made by subsystems such as Dired and Rmail that
have special commands to operate on the text; also by visiting a file
whose access control says you cannot write it.

   <p><a name="index-toggle_002dread_002donly-1078"></a>  If you wish to make changes in a read-only buffer, use the command
<kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> (<code>toggle-read-only</code>).  It makes a read-only buffer
writable, and makes a writable buffer read-only.  This
works by setting the variable <code>buffer-read-only</code>, which has a local
value in each buffer and makes the buffer read-only if its value is
non-<code>nil</code>.  If you have files under version control, you may find
it convenient to bind <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> to <code>vc-toggle-read-only</code>
instead.  This will guard you against an operation that will confuse
most modern version-conmtrol systems. See <a href="Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>.

   <p><a name="index-rename_002dbuffer-1079"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-buffer</kbd> changes the name of the current buffer.  You
specify the new name as a minibuffer argument; there is no default. 
If you specify a name that is in use for some other buffer, an error
happens and no renaming is done.

   <p><a name="index-rename_002duniquely-1080"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-uniquely</kbd> renames the current buffer to a similar
name with a numeric suffix added to make it both different and unique. 
This command does not need an argument.  It is useful for creating
multiple shell buffers: if you rename the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*shell*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, then
do <kbd>M-x shell</kbd> again, it makes a new shell buffer named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*shell*</span></samp>&rsquo;; meanwhile, the old shell buffer continues to exist
under its new name.  This method is also good for mail buffers,
compilation buffers, and most Emacs features that create special
buffers with particular names.  (With some of these features, such as
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd>, <kbd>M-x grep</kbd> an <kbd>M-x info</kbd>, you need to
switch to some other buffer before using the command, in order for it
to make a different buffer.)

   <p><a name="index-view_002dbuffer-1081"></a>  <kbd>M-x view-buffer</kbd> is much like <kbd>M-x view-file</kbd> (see <a href="Misc-File-Ops.html#Misc-File-Ops">Misc File Ops</a>) except that it examines an already existing Emacs buffer. 
View mode provides commands for scrolling through the buffer
conveniently but not for changing it.  When you exit View mode with
<kbd>q</kbd>, that switches back to the buffer (and the position) which was
previously displayed in the window.  Alternatively, if you exit View
mode with <kbd>e</kbd>, the buffer and the value of point that resulted from
your perusal remain in effect.

   <p>The commands <kbd>M-x append-to-buffer</kbd> and <kbd>M-x insert-buffer</kbd>
can be used to copy text from one buffer to another.  See <a href="Accumulating-Text.html#Accumulating-Text">Accumulating Text</a>.
