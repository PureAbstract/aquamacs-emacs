<h3 class="section">40.2 When Gnus Starts Up</h3>

<p>At startup, Gnus reads your <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> news initialization file
and attempts to communicate with the local news server, which is a
repository of news articles.  The news server need not be the same
computer you are logged in on.

   <p>If you start Gnus and connect to the server, but do not see any
newsgroups listed in the group buffer, type <kbd>L</kbd> or <kbd>A k</kbd> to get
a listing of all the groups.  Then type <kbd>u</kbd> to toggle
subscription to groups.

   <p>The first time you start Gnus, Gnus subscribes you to a few selected
groups.  All other groups start out as <dfn>killed groups</dfn> for you; you
can list them with <kbd>A k</kbd>.  All new groups that subsequently come to
exist at the news server become <dfn>zombie groups</dfn> for you; type <kbd>A
z</kbd> to list them.  You can subscribe to a group shown in these lists
using the <kbd>u</kbd> command.

   <p>When you quit Gnus with <kbd>q</kbd>, it automatically records in your
<samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.newsrc.eld</span></samp> initialization files the
subscribed or unsubscribed status of all groups.  You should normally
not edit these files manually, but you may if you know how.
