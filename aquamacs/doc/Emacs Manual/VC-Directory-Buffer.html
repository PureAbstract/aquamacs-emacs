<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.6.1 The VC Directory Buffer</h5>

<p>The VC Directory buffer contains a list of version-controlled files
in the current directory and its subdirectories.  Files which are
up-to-date (have no local differences from the repository copy) are
usually hidden; if all files in a subdirectory are up-to-date, the
subdirectory is hidden as well.  There is an exception to this rule:
if VC mode detects that a file has changed to an up-to-date state
since you last looked at it, that file and its state are shown.

   <p>If a directory uses more that one version control system, you can
select which system to use for the <code>vc-dir</code> command by invoking
<code>vc-dir</code> with a prefix argument: <kbd>C-u C-x v d</kbd>.

   <p>The line for an individual file shows the version control state of
the file.  Under RCS and SCCS, the name of the user locking the file
is shown; under CVS, an abbreviated version of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs status</span></samp>&rsquo;
output is used.  Here is an example using CVS:

<pre class="smallexample">                            ./
         modified           file1.c
         needs-update       file2.c
         needs-merge        file3.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file1.c</span></samp>&rsquo; is modified with respect to the
repository, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file2.c</span></samp>&rsquo; is not.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file3.c</span></samp>&rsquo; is modified,
but other changes have also been checked in to the repository&mdash;you
need to merge them with the work file before you can check it in.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dstay_002dlocal-2480"></a><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dstay_002dlocal-2481"></a>  In the above, if the repository were on a remote machine, VC only
contacts it when the variable <code>vc-stay-local</code> (or
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code>) is <code>nil</code>
(see <a href="CVS-Options.html#CVS-Options">CVS Options</a>). 
This is because access to the repository may be slow, or you may be
working offline and not have access to the repository at all.  As a
consequence, VC would not be able to tell you that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file3.c</span></samp>&rsquo; is
in the &ldquo;merge&rdquo; state; you would learn that only when you try to
check-in your modified copy of the file, or use a command such as
<kbd>C-x v m</kbd>.

   <p>In practice, this is not a problem because CVS handles this case
consistently whenever it arises.  In VC, you'll simply get prompted to
merge the remote changes into your work file first.  The benefits of
less network communication usually outweigh the disadvantage of not
seeing remote changes immediately.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddirectory_002dexclusion_002dlist-2482"></a>  When a VC directory displays subdirectories it omits some that
should never contain any files under version control.  By default,
this includes Version Control subdirectories such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RCS</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CVS</span></samp>&rsquo;; you can customize this by setting the variable
<code>vc-directory-exclusion-list</code>.
