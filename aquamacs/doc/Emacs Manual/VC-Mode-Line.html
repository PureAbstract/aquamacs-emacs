<h4 class="subsection">32.1.2 Version Control and the Mode Line</h4>

<p>When you visit a file that is under version control, Emacs indicates
this on the mode line.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RCS-1.3</span></samp>&rsquo; says that RCS is
used for that file, and the current version is 1.3.

   <p>The character between the back-end name and the revision ID
indicates the version control status of the file.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; means that
the work file is not locked (if locking is in use), or not modified (if
locking is not in use).  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates that the file is locked, or
that it is modified.  If the file is locked by some other user (for
instance, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">jim</span></samp>&rsquo;), that is displayed as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RCS:jim:1.3</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>On a graphical display, you can move the mouse over this mode line
indicator to pop up a &ldquo;tool-tip&rdquo;, which displays a more verbose
description of the version control status.  Pressing <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>
over the indicator pops up a menu of VC commands.  This menu is
identical to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tools / Version Control</span></samp>&rsquo; menu item.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dcheck_002dvc_002dinfo-2442"></a>  When Auto Revert mode (see <a href="Reverting.html#Reverting">Reverting</a>) reverts a buffer that is
under version control, it updates the version control information in
the mode line.  However, Auto Revert mode may not properly update this
information if the version control status changes without changes to
the work file, from outside the current Emacs session.  If you set
<code>auto-revert-check-vc-info</code> to <code>t</code>, Auto Revert mode updates
the version control status information every
<code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds, even if the work file itself is
unchanged.  The resulting CPU usage depends on the version control
system, but is usually not excessive.
