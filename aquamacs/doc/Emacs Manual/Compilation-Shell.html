<h3 class="section">31.3 Subshells for Compilation</h3>

<p>Emacs uses a shell to run the compilation command, but specifies the
option for a noninteractive shell.  This means, in particular, that
the shell should start with no prompt.  If you find your usual shell
prompt making an unsightly appearance in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*compilation*</span></samp>&rsquo;
buffer, it means you have made a mistake in your shell's init file by
setting the prompt unconditionally.  (This init file's name may be
<samp><span class="file">.bashrc</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.profile</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.cshrc</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.shrc</span></samp>, or
various other things, depending on the shell you use.)  The shell init
file should set the prompt only if there already is a prompt.  Here's
how to do it in bash:

<pre class="example">     if [ "${PS1+set}" = set ]
     then PS1=...
     fi
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And here's how to do it in csh:

<pre class="example">     if ($?prompt) set prompt = ...
</pre>
   <p>There may well be other things that your shell's init file
ought to do only for an interactive shell.  You can use the same
method to conditionalize them.

   <p>The MS-DOS &ldquo;operating system&rdquo; does not support asynchronous
subprocesses; to work around this lack, <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> runs the
compilation command synchronously on MS-DOS.  As a consequence, you must
wait until the command finishes before you can do anything else in
Emacs.
