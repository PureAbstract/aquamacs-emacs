<h2 class="chapter">5 Entering Emacs</h2>

<p><a name="index-entering-Emacs-43"></a><a name="index-starting-Emacs-44"></a>
  The usual way to invoke Emacs is with the shell command
<samp><span class="command">emacs</span></samp>.  From a terminal window running in the X Window
System, you can also run Emacs in the background with
<samp><span class="command">emacs&amp;</span></samp>; this way, Emacs won't tie up the terminal window, so
you can use it to run other shell commands.

   <p><a name="index-startup-screen-45"></a>  When Emacs starts up, the initial frame displays a special buffer
named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*GNU Emacs*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This buffer contains some information about
Emacs, and includes <dfn>links</dfn> to common tasks that might be useful
to beginning users.  For instance, activating the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Emacs
Tutorial</span></samp>&rsquo; link opens the Emacs tutorial; this does the same thing as
the command <kbd>C-h t</kbd> (<code>help-with-tutorial</code>).  To activate a
link, either move point onto it and type <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, or click on
it with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> (the left mouse button).

   <p>Using a command line argument, you can tell Emacs to visit one or
more specific files as soon as it starts up.  For example,
<samp><span class="command">emacs foo.txt</span></samp> starts Emacs with a buffer displaying the
contents of the file &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.txt</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This feature exists mainly for
compatibility with other editors, which are designed to edit one file
at a time: once you are done with that file, you exit the editor, and
start it again the next time you need it.

   <p>Using Emacs in this way&mdash;starting it afresh each time you want to
edit a file&mdash;is unnecessary and wasteful.  Emacs can visit more than
one file in a single editing session, and exiting the Emacs session
loses valuable accumulated context, such as the kill ring, registers,
undo history, and mark ring.  These features, described later in the
manual, are useful for performing edits across multiple files, or
continuing edits to a single file.

   <p>The recommended way to use Emacs is to start it only once, just
after you log in, and do all your editing in the same Emacs session. 
Each time you edit a file, visit it with the existing Emacs, which
eventually has many files in it ready for editing.  See <a href="Files.html#Files">Files</a>, for
more information on visiting more than one file.

   <p>To edit a file from another program while Emacs is running, you can
use the <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> helper program to open a file in the
already running Emacs.  See <a href="Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.

   <p>Emacs accepts other command line arguments that tell it to load
certain Lisp files, call certain functions, and so forth.  These
features exist mainly for advanced users.  See <a href="Emacs-Invocation.html#Emacs-Invocation">Emacs Invocation</a>.

   <p><a name="index-inhibit_002dstartup_002dscreen-46"></a>  If the variable <code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
Emacs does not display the startup screen.  In that case, if one or
more files were specified on the command line, Emacs simply displays
those files; otherwise, it displays a buffer named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*scratch*</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which can be used to evaluate Emacs Lisp expressions interactively. 
See <a href="Lisp-Interaction.html#Lisp-Interaction">Lisp Interaction</a>.  You can set the variable
<code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> using the Customize facility
(see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or by editing your initialization file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>You can also force Emacs to display a file or directory at startup
by setting the variable <code>initial-buffer-choice</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  (In that case, even if you specify one or more
files on the command line, Emacs opens but does not display them.) 
The value of <code>initial-buffer-choice</code> can be either the name of
the desired file or directory, or <code>t</code>, which means to display the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*scratch*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Note that setting
<code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> in <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> doesn't work,
because the startup screen is set up before reading
<samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>.  See <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>, for information about
<samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>.</p>
