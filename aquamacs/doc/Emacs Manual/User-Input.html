<h2 class="chapter">2 Kinds of User Input</h2>

<p><a name="index-input-with-the-keyboard-20"></a><a name="index-keyboard-input-21"></a><a name="index-character-set-_0028keyboard_0029-22"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bASCII_007d-23"></a><a name="index-C_002d-24"></a><a name="index-Control-25"></a><a name="index-control-characters-26"></a>
  GNU Emacs is primarily designed for use with the keyboard.  While it
is possible to use the mouse to issue editing commands through the
menu bar and tool bar, that is not as efficient as using the keyboard. 
Therefore, this manual mainly documents how to edit with the keyboard.

   <p>Keyboard input into Emacs is based on a heavily-extended version of
<acronym>ASCII</acronym>.  The simplest characters that you can input into
Emacs correspond to graphic symbols such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;, the space character (conventionally denoted as
&lt;SPC&gt;), and so on.  Entering these using the keyboard is
straightforward.  Certain characters found on non-English keyboards
also fall into this category (see <a href="International.html#International">International</a>).

   <p>In addition to these simple characters, Emacs recognizes
<dfn>control characters</dfn> such as &lt;RET&gt;, &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;DEL&gt;,
&lt;ESC&gt;, &lt;F1&gt;, &lt;Home&gt;, &lt;left&gt;, etc.  Most keyboards have
special keys for entering these.

   <p><a name="index-modifier-keys-27"></a><a name="index-Control-28"></a><a name="index-C_002d-29"></a><a name="index-Meta-30"></a><a name="index-M_002d-31"></a>  Emacs also recognizes control characters that are entered using
<dfn>modifier keys</dfn>.  Two commonly-used modifier keys are
&lt;Control&gt; (which is usually labelled as &lt;Ctrl&gt;), and
&lt;Meta&gt; (which is usually labeled as &lt;Alt&gt;)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  For example,
<kbd>Control-a</kbd> is entered by holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key while
pressing <kbd>a</kbd>; we will refer to this as <kbd>C-a</kbd> for short. 
Similarly <kbd>Meta-a</kbd>, or <kbd>M-a</kbd> for short, is entered by holding
down the &lt;Alt&gt; key and pressing <kbd>a</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bESC_007d-replacing-_0040key_007bMeta_007d-key-32"></a>  You can also type Meta characters using two-character sequences
starting with &lt;ESC&gt;.  Thus, you can enter <kbd>M-a</kbd> by typing
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; a</kbd>.  You can enter <kbd>C-M-a</kbd> by typing <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;
C-a</kbd>.  Unlike &lt;Meta&gt;, &lt;ESC&gt; is entered as a separate
character.  You don't hold down &lt;ESC&gt; while typing the next
character; instead, press &lt;ESC&gt; and release it, then enter the
next character.  This feature is useful on certain text-only terminals
where the &lt;Meta&gt; key does not function reliably.

   <p>Modifier keys can apply not only to alphanumerical characters, but
also to special input characters, such as the arrow keys and mouse
buttons.

   <p><a name="index-input-event-33"></a>  See <a href="../elisp/Input-Events.html#Input-Events">Input Events</a>, for
the full Lisp-level details about keyboard and mouse input, which are
collectively referred to as <dfn>input events</dfn>.  If you are not doing
Lisp programming, but simply want to redefine the meaning of some
characters or non-character events, see <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>.

   <p><a name="index-keys-stolen-by-window-manager-34"></a><a name="index-window-manager_002c-keys-stolen-by-35"></a>  On graphical displays, the window manager is likely to block the
character <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> before Emacs can see it.  It may also
block <kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>C-M-d</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-l</kbd>.  If you have
these problems, we recommend that you customize your window manager to
turn off those commands, or put them on key combinations that Emacs
does not use.
