<h4 class="subsection">57.4.1 Keymaps</h4>

<p><a name="index-keymap-3982"></a>
  The bindings between key sequences and command functions are recorded
in data structures called <dfn>keymaps</dfn>.  Emacs has many of these, each
used on particular occasions.

   <p>A <dfn>key sequence</dfn> (<dfn>key</dfn>, for short) is a sequence of
<dfn>input events</dfn> that have a meaning as a unit.  Input events
include characters, function keys and mouse buttons&mdash;all the inputs
that you can send to the computer with your terminal.  A key sequence
gets its meaning from its <dfn>binding</dfn>, which says what command it
runs.  The role of keymaps is to record these bindings.

   <p><a name="index-global-keymap-3983"></a>  The <dfn>global</dfn> keymap is the most important keymap because it is
always in effect.  The global keymap defines keys for Fundamental mode;
most of these definitions are common to most or all major modes.  Each
major or minor mode can have its own keymap which overrides the global
definitions of some keys.

   <p>For example, a self-inserting character such as <kbd>g</kbd> is
self-inserting because the global keymap binds it to the command
<code>self-insert-command</code>.  The standard Emacs editing characters such
as <kbd>C-a</kbd> also get their standard meanings from the global keymap. 
Commands to rebind keys, such as <kbd>M-x global-set-key</kbd>, actually work
by storing the new binding in the proper place in the global map. 
See <a href="Rebinding.html#Rebinding">Rebinding</a>.

   <p><a name="index-function-key-3984"></a>  Most modern keyboards have function keys as well as character keys. 
Function keys send input events just as character keys do, and keymaps
can have bindings for them.  On text terminals, typing a function key
actually sends the computer a sequence of characters; the precise
details of the sequence depends on which function key and on the model
of terminal you are using.  (Often the sequence starts with
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; [</kbd>.)  If Emacs understands your terminal type properly,
it recognizes the character sequences forming function keys wherever
they occur in a key sequence.  Thus, for most purposes, you can
pretend the function keys reach Emacs directly and ignore their
encoding as character sequences.

   <p>Key sequences can mix function keys and characters.  For example, if
your keyboard has a &lt;Home&gt; function key, Emacs also recognizes key
sequences like <kbd>C-x &lt;Home&gt;</kbd>.  You can even mix mouse events
with keyboard events, but we recommend against it, because such key
sequences are inconvenient to use.

   <p>As a user, you can redefine any key, but it is usually best to stick
to key sequences that consist of <kbd>C-c</kbd> followed by a letter (upper
or lower case).  These keys are &ldquo;reserved for users,&rdquo; so they won't
conflict with any properly designed Emacs extension.  The function
keys &lt;F5&gt; through &lt;F9&gt; are also reserved for users.  If you
redefine some other key, your definition may be overridden by certain
extensions or major modes which redefine the same key.
