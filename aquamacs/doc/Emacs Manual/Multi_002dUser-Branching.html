<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.7.4 Multi-User Branching</h5>

<p>It is often useful for multiple developers to work simultaneously on
different branches of a file.  CVS and later systems allow this by
default; for RCS, it is possible if you create multiple source
directories.  Each source directory should have a link named
<samp><span class="file">RCS</span></samp> which points to a common directory of RCS master files. 
Then each source directory can have its own choice of selected
revisions, but all share the same common RCS records.

   <p>This technique works reliably and automatically, provided that the
source files contain RCS version headers
(see <a href="Version-Headers.html#Version-Headers">Version Headers</a>). 
The headers enable Emacs to be sure, at all times, which revision
ID is present in the work file.

   <p>If the files do not have version headers, you must instead tell Emacs
explicitly in each session which branch you are working on.  To do this,
first find the file, then type <kbd>C-u C-x v v</kbd> and specify the correct
branch ID.  This ensures that Emacs knows which branch it is using
during this particular editing session.
