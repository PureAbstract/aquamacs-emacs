<h4 class="subsection">22.5.3 Adding Support for Auto-Reverting additional Buffers.</h4>

<p>This section is intended for Elisp programmers who would like to add
support for auto-reverting new types of buffers.

   <p>To support auto-reverting the buffer must first of all have a
<code>revert-buffer-function</code>.  See <a href="../elisp/Definition-of-revert_002dbuffer_002dfunction.html#Definition-of-revert_002dbuffer_002dfunction">Reverting</a>.

   <p>In addition, it <em>must</em> have a <code>buffer-stale-function</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>buffer-stale-function</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dstale_002dfunction-892"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a function to check whether a non-file
buffer needs reverting.  This should be a function with one optional
argument <var>noconfirm</var>.  The function should return non-<code>nil</code>
if the buffer should be reverted.  The buffer is current when this
function is called.

        <p>While this function is mainly intended for use in auto-reverting, it
could be used for other purposes as well.  For instance, if
auto-reverting is not enabled, it could be used to warn the user that
the buffer needs reverting.  The idea behind the <var>noconfirm</var>
argument is that it should be <code>t</code> if the buffer is going to be
reverted without asking the user and <code>nil</code> if the function is
just going to be used to warn the user that the buffer is out of date. 
In particular, for use in auto-reverting, <var>noconfirm</var> is <code>t</code>. 
If the function is only going to be used for auto-reverting, you can
ignore the <var>noconfirm</var> argument.

        <p>If you just want to automatically auto-revert every
<code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds, use:

     <pre class="example">          (set (make-local-variable 'buffer-stale-function)
               #'(lambda (&amp;optional noconfirm) 'fast))
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">in the buffer's mode function.

        <p>The special return value `<samp><span class="samp">fast</span></samp>' tells the caller that the need
for reverting was not checked, but that reverting the buffer is fast. 
It also tells Auto Revert not to print any revert messages, even if
<code>auto-revert-verbose</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  This is important, as
getting revert messages every <code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds can
be very annoying.  The information provided by this return value could
also be useful if the function is consulted for purposes other than
auto-reverting. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Once the buffer has a <code>revert-buffer-function</code> and a
<code>buffer-stale-function</code>, several problems usually remain.

   <p>The buffer will only auto-revert if it is marked unmodified.  Hence,
you will have to make sure that various functions mark the buffer
modified if and only if either the buffer contains information that
might be lost by reverting or there is reason to believe that the user
might be inconvenienced by auto-reverting, because he is actively
working on the buffer.  The user can always override this by manually
adjusting the modified status of the buffer.  To support this, calling
the <code>revert-buffer-function</code> on a buffer that is marked
unmodified should always keep the buffer marked unmodified.

   <p>It is important to assure that point does not continuously jump around
as a consequence of auto-reverting.  Of course, moving point might be
inevitable if the buffer radically changes.

   <p>You should make sure that the <code>revert-buffer-function</code> does not
print messages that unnecessarily duplicate Auto Revert's own messages
if <code>auto-revert-verbose</code> is <code>t</code> and effectively override a
<code>nil</code> value for <code>auto-revert-verbose</code>.  Hence, adapting a
mode for auto-reverting often involves getting rid of such messages. 
This is especially important for buffers that automatically
auto-revert every <code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds.

   <p>Also, you may want to update the documentation string of
<code>global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers</code>.

   <p>Finally, you should add a section to this chapter.  This section
should at the very least make clear whether enabling auto-reverting
for the buffer reliably assures that all information in the buffer is
completely up to date (or will be after <code>auto-revert-interval</code>
seconds).
