<h4 class="subsection">8.3.3 Strict Completion</h4>

<p>There are three different ways that &lt;RET&gt; can do completion,
depending on how the argument will be used.

     <ul>
<li><dfn>Strict</dfn> completion accepts only known completion candidates.  For
example, when <kbd>C-x k</kbd> reads the name of a buffer to kill, only the
name of an existing buffer makes sense.  In strict completion,
&lt;RET&gt; refuses to exit if the text in the minibuffer does not
complete to an exact match.

     <li><dfn>Cautious</dfn> completion is similar to strict completion, except that
&lt;RET&gt; exits only if the text is an already exact match. 
Otherwise, &lt;RET&gt; does not exit, but it does complete the text.  If
that completes to an exact match, a second &lt;RET&gt; will exit.

     <p>Cautious completion is used for reading file names for files that must
already exist, for example.

     <li><dfn>Permissive</dfn> completion allows any input; the completion
candidates are just suggestions.  For example, when <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
reads the name of a file to visit, any file name is allowed, including
nonexistent file (in case you want to create a file).  In permissive
completion, &lt;RET&gt; does not complete, it just submits the argument
as you have entered it. 
</ul>

   <p>The completion commands display a list of all possible completions
whenever they can't determine even one more character by completion. 
Also, typing <kbd>?</kbd> explicitly requests such a list.  You can scroll
the list with <kbd>C-M-v</kbd> (see <a href="Other-Window.html#Other-Window">Other Window</a>).
