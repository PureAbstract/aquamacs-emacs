     <dl>
<dt>Input/Output Buffer<dd><a name="index-gdb_002duse_002dseparate_002dio_002dbuffer-2366"></a>If the variable <code>gdb-use-separate-io-buffer</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
the program being debugged takes its input and displays its output
here.  Otherwise it uses the GUD buffer for that.  To toggle whether
GUD mode uses this buffer, do <kbd>M-x gdb-use-separate-io-buffer</kbd>. 
This takes effect when you next restart the program you are debugging.

     <p>The history and replay commands from Shell mode are available here,
as are the commands to send signals to the debugged program. 
See <a href="Shell-Mode.html#Shell-Mode">Shell Mode</a>.

     <br><dt>Locals Buffer<dd>The locals buffer displays the values of local variables of the
current frame for simple data types (see <a href="../gdb/Frame-Info.html#Frame-Info">Frame Info</a>).  Press &lt;RET&gt; or
click <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> on the value if you want to edit it.

     <p>Arrays and structures display their type only.  With GDB 6.4 or later,
move point to their name and press &lt;RET&gt;, or alternatively click
<kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> there, to examine their values.  With earlier versions
of GDB, use <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> or &lt;RET&gt; on the type description
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[struct/union]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[array]</span></samp>&rsquo;).  See <a href="Watch-Expressions.html#Watch-Expressions">Watch Expressions</a>.

     <br><dt>Registers Buffer<dd><a name="index-toggle_002dgdb_002dall_002dregisters-2367"></a>The registers buffer displays the values held by the registers
(see <a href="../gdb/Registers.html#Registers">Registers</a>).  Press &lt;RET&gt; or
click <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> on a register if you want to edit its value. 
With GDB 6.4 or later, recently changed register values display with
<code>font-lock-warning-face</code>.  With earlier versions of GDB, you can
press &lt;SPC&gt; to toggle the display of floating point registers
(<code>toggle-gdb-all-registers</code>).

     <br><dt>Assembler Buffer<dd>The assembler buffer displays the current frame as machine code.  An
arrow points to the current instruction, and you can set and remove
breakpoints as in a source buffer.  Breakpoint icons also appear in
the fringe or margin.

     <br><dt>Threads Buffer<dd><a name="index-gdb_002dthreads_002dselect-2368"></a>The threads buffer displays a summary of all threads currently in your
program (see <a href="../gdb/Threads.html#Threads">Threads</a>).  Move point to any thread in the
list and press &lt;RET&gt; to select it (<code>gdb-threads-select</code>) and
display the associated source in the primary source buffer. 
Alternatively, click <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> on a thread to select it.  If the
locals buffer is visible, its contents update to display the variables
that are local in the new thread.

     <p>When there is more than one main thread and the threads buffer is
present, Emacs displays the selected thread number in the mode line of
many of the GDB-UI Buffers.

     <br><dt>Memory Buffer<dd>The memory buffer lets you examine sections of program memory
(see <a href="../gdb/Memory.html#Memory">Memory</a>). 
Click <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> on the appropriate part of the header line to
change the starting address or number of data items that the buffer
displays.  Alternatively, use <kbd>S</kbd> or <kbd>N</kbd> respectively.  Click
<kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> on the header line to select the display format or unit
size for these data items. 
</dl>

   <p>When <code>gdb-many-windows</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, the threads buffer
shares its window with the breakpoints buffer, and the locals buffer
with the registers buffer.  To switch from one to the other click with
<kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> on the relevant button in the header line.
