<h4 class="subsection">38.15.8 Fancy Diary Display</h4>

<p>The following features only work with the fancy diary display.

   <p><a name="index-sorting-diary-entries-3465"></a>  You can use the normal hook <code>diary-list-entries-hook</code> to sort
each day's diary entries by their time of day.  Here's how:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dsort_002dentries-3466"></a>
<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-sort-entries t)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For each day, this sorts diary entries that begin with a recognizable
time of day according to their times.  Diary entries without times come
first within each day.

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dinclude_002dstring-3467"></a>  Your main diary file can include other files.  This permits a group of
people to share a diary file for events that apply to all of them. 
Lines in the diary file starting with <code>diary-include-string</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include "<var>filename</var>"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">include the diary entries from the file <var>filename</var> in the fancy
diary buffer.  The include mechanism is recursive, so that included
files can include other files, and so on (you must be careful not to
have a cycle of inclusions, of course).  Here is how to enable the
include facility:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dlist_002dentries_002dhook-3468"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmark_002dentries_002dhook-3469"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinclude_002dother_002ddiary_002dfiles-3470"></a><a name="index-diary_002dmark_002dincluded_002ddiary_002dfiles-3471"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     (add-hook 'diary-list-entries-hook 'diary-include-other-diary-files)
     (add-hook 'diary-mark-entries-hook 'diary-mark-included-diary-files)
</pre>
   <p>The include mechanism works only with the fancy diary display, because
simple diary display shows the entries directly from your diary file.
