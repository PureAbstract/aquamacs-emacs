<h3 class="section">11.2 Commands to Mark Textual Objects</h3>

<p><a name="index-marking-sections-of-text-307"></a>  Here are the commands for placing point and the mark around a textual
object such as a word, list, paragraph or page:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-@</kbd><dd>Set mark after end of next word (<code>mark-word</code>).  This does not
move point. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-@</kbd><dd>Set mark after end of following balanced expression
(<code>mark-sexp</code>).  This does not move point. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-h</kbd><dd>Move point to the beginning of the current paragraph, and set mark at
the end (<code>mark-paragraph</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-h</kbd><dd>Move point to the beginning of the current defun, and set mark at the
end (<code>mark-defun</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-p</kbd><dd>Move point to the beginning of the current page, and set mark at the
end (<code>mark-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x h</kbd><dd>Move point to the beginning of the buffer, and set mark at the end
(<code>mark-whole-buffer</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-mark_002dword-308"></a><a name="index-mark_002dsexp-309"></a><kbd>M-@</kbd> (<code>mark-word</code>) puts the mark at the end of the next
word, while <kbd>C-M-@</kbd> (<code>mark-sexp</code>) puts it at the end of the
next balanced expression (see <a href="Expressions.html#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  These commands handle
arguments just like <kbd>M-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-h-310"></a><a name="index-mark_002dwhole_002dbuffer-311"></a>   The other commands in the above list set both point and mark, so as
to delimit an object in the buffer.  <kbd>M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-paragraph</code>)
moves point to the beginning of the paragraph that surrounds or
follows point, and sets the mark at the end of that paragraph
(see <a href="Paragraphs.html#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>).  As a special exception, repeated invocations of
<kbd>M-h</kbd> extend the region to subsequent paragraphs.  This is
convenient for indenting, case-converting, or killing entire
paragraphs.

   <p>The <kbd>M-h</kbd> command accepts prefix arguments.  If the argument's
value is positive, <kbd>M-h</kbd> marks that many paragraphs starting with
the one surrounding point; therefore, <kbd>C-u M-h</kbd> is equivalent to
<kbd>M-h M-h M-h M-h</kbd>.  If the prefix argument is &minus;<var>n</var>,
<kbd>M-h</kbd> marks <var>n</var> paragraphs running back from the one
surrounding point; in this case, point moves forward to the end of
that paragraph, and the mark goes at the start of the region.

   <p>Similarly, <kbd>C-M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-defun</code>) sets mark and point
around major top-level definitions (see <a href="Moving-by-Defuns.html#Moving-by-Defuns">Moving by Defuns</a>), and
<kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> (<code>mark-page</code>) does the same for pages
(see <a href="Pages.html#Pages">Pages</a>).  These treat repeated invocations and prefix
arguments similarly to <code>mark-paragraph</code>.

   <p>Finally, <kbd>C-x h</kbd> (<code>mark-whole-buffer</code>) sets up the entire
buffer as the region, by putting point at the beginning and the mark
at the end.  (In some programs this is called &ldquo;select all.&rdquo;)
