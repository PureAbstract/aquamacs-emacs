<h4 class="subsection">29.12.9 Forcing Enriched Mode</h4>

<p>Normally, Emacs knows when you are editing formatted text because it
recognizes the special annotations used in the file that you visited. 
However, sometimes you must take special actions to convert file
contents or turn on Enriched mode:

     <ul>
<li>When you visit a file that was created with some other editor, Emacs may
not recognize the file as being in the text/enriched format.  In this
case, when you visit the file you will see the formatting commands
rather than the formatted text.  Type <kbd>M-x format-decode-buffer</kbd> to
translate it.  This also automatically turns on Enriched mode.

     <li>When you <em>insert</em> a file into a buffer, rather than visiting it,
Emacs does the necessary conversions on the text which you insert, but
it does not enable Enriched mode.  If you wish to do that, type <kbd>M-x
enriched-mode</kbd>. 
</ul>

   <p>The command <code>format-decode-buffer</code> translates text in various
formats into Emacs's internal format.  It asks you to specify the format
to translate from; however, normally you can type just &lt;RET&gt;, which
tells Emacs to guess the format.

   <p><a name="index-format_002dfind_002dfile-1872"></a>  If you wish to look at a text/enriched file in its raw form, as a
sequence of characters rather than as formatted text, use the <kbd>M-x
find-file-literally</kbd> command.  This visits a file, like
<code>find-file</code>, but does not do format conversion.  It also inhibits
character code conversion (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>) and automatic
uncompression (see <a href="Compressed-Files.html#Compressed-Files">Compressed Files</a>).  To disable format conversion
but allow character code conversion and/or automatic uncompression if
appropriate, use <code>format-find-file</code> with suitable arguments.
