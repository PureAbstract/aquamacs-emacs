<h4 class="subsection">57.4.3 Local Keymaps</h4>

<p><a name="index-local-keymap-3990"></a>  So far we have explained the ins and outs of the global map.  Major
modes customize Emacs by providing their own key bindings in <dfn>local
keymaps</dfn>.  For example, C mode overrides &lt;TAB&gt; to make it indent the
current line for C code.  Portions of text in the buffer can specify
their own keymaps to substitute for the keymap of the buffer's major
mode.

   <p><a name="index-minor-mode-keymap-3991"></a>  Minor modes can also have local keymaps.  Whenever a minor mode is
in effect, the definitions in its keymap override both the major
mode's local keymap and the global keymap.

   <p>A local keymap can locally redefine a key as a prefix key by defining
it as a prefix keymap.  If the key is also defined globally as a prefix,
then its local and global definitions (both keymaps) effectively
combine: both of them are used to look up the event that follows the
prefix key.  Thus, if the mode's local keymap defines <kbd>C-c</kbd> as
another keymap, and that keymap defines <kbd>C-z</kbd> as a command, this
provides a local meaning for <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd>.  This does not affect other
sequences that start with <kbd>C-c</kbd>; if those sequences don't have their
own local bindings, their global bindings remain in effect.

   <p>Another way to think of this is that Emacs handles a multi-event key
sequence by looking in several keymaps, one by one, for a binding of the
whole key sequence.  First it checks the minor mode keymaps for minor
modes that are enabled, then it checks the major mode's keymap, and then
it checks the global keymap.  This is not precisely how key lookup
works, but it's good enough for understanding the results in ordinary
circumstances.

   <p><a name="index-rebinding-major-mode-keys-3992"></a>  Most major modes construct their keymaps when the mode is used for
the first time in a session.  If you wish to change one of these
keymaps, you must use the major mode's <dfn>mode hook</dfn>
(see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p><a name="index-define_002dkey-3993"></a>  For example, the command <code>texinfo-mode</code> to select Texinfo mode
runs the hook <code>texinfo-mode-hook</code>.  Here's how you can use the hook
to add local bindings (not very useful, we admit) for <kbd>C-c n</kbd> and
<kbd>C-c p</kbd> in Texinfo mode:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'texinfo-mode-hook
               '(lambda ()
                  (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-cp"
                              'backward-paragraph)
                  (define-key texinfo-mode-map "\C-cn"
                              'forward-paragraph)))
</pre>
   </body></html>
