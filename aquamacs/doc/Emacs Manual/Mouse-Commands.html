</dl>

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dpoint-1175"></a>  The most basic mouse command is <code>mouse-set-point</code>, which is
called by clicking with the left mouse button, <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, in the
text area of a window.  This moves point to the position where you
clicked.

   <p><a name="index-x_002dmouse_002dclick_002dfocus_002dignore_002dposition-1176"></a>  Normally, Emacs does not distinguish between ordinary mouse clicks
and clicks that select a frame.  When you click on a frame to select
it, that also changes the selected window and cursor position
according to the mouse click position.  On the X window system, you
can change this behavior by setting the variable
<code>x-mouse-click-focus-ignore-position</code> to <code>t</code>.  Then the
first click selects the frame, but does not affect the selected window
or cursor position.  If you click again in the same place, that click
will be in the selected frame, so it will change the window or cursor
position.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dregion-1177"></a><a name="index-mouse_002ddrag_002dcopy_002dregion-1178"></a>  Holding down <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> and &ldquo;dragging&rdquo; the mouse over a stretch
of text activates the region around that text
(<code>mouse-set-region</code>).  See <a href="Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>.  Emacs places the mark where
you started holding down the mouse button, and point where you release
it.  In addition, the region is copied into the kill ring (see <a href="Kill-Ring.html#Kill-Ring">Kill Ring</a>).  If you don't want Emacs to copy the region, change the
variable <code>mouse-drag-copy-region</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dscroll_002dmin_002dlines-1179"></a>  If you move the mouse off the top or bottom of the window while
dragging, the window scrolls at a steady rate until you move the mouse
back into the window.  This way, you can select regions that don't fit
entirely on the screen.  The number of lines scrolled per step depends
on how far away from the window edge the mouse has gone; the variable
<code>mouse-scroll-min-lines</code> specifies a minimum step size.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dclick-1180"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dpoint-1181"></a>  Clicking with the middle mouse button, <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd>, moves point to
the position where you clicked and performs a yank
(<code>mouse-yank-at-click</code>).  See <a href="Yanking.html#Yanking">Yanking</a>.  If you change the
variable <code>mouse-yank-at-point</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value,
<kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> does not move point.  Then it does not matter where you
click, or even which of the frame's windows you click on; the yank
occurs at the existing point.  This variable also affects yanking the
primary and secondary selections (see <a href="Cut_002fPaste-Other-App.html#Cut_002fPaste-Other-App">Cut/Paste Other App</a>).

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dsave_002dthen_002dkill-1182"></a>  Clicking with the right mouse button, <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd>, runs the
command <code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>.  This performs several actions
depending on where you click and the status of the region:

     <ul>
<li>If no region is active, clicking <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> activates the region,
placing the mark where point was and point at the clicked position. 
In addition, the text in the region is copied to the kill ring.

     <li>If a region is active, clicking <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> adjusts the nearer end
of the region by moving it to the clicked position.  The adjusted
region's text is copied to the kill ring; if the text in the original
region was already on the kill ring, it replaces it there.

     <li>If you originally specified the region using a double or triple
<kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, so that the region is defined to consist of entire
words or lines, then adjusting the region with <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> also
proceeds by entire words or lines.

     <li>If you use <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> a second time consecutively, at the same
place, that kills the region already selected.  Thus, the simplest way
to kill text with the mouse is to click <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> at one end, then
click <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> twice at the other end.  To copy the text into the
kill ring without deleting it from the buffer, press <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd>
just once&mdash;or just drag across the text with <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>.  Then you
can copy it elsewhere by yanking it. 
</ul>

   <p>Whenever you set the region using any of the mouse commands
described above, the mark will be deactivated by any subsequent
unshifted cursor motion command, in addition to the usual ways of
deactivating the mark.  See <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>.  While the region
remains active, typing &lt;Backspace&gt; or &lt;Delete&gt; deletes the
text in that region and deactivates the mark; this behavior follows a
convention established by other graphical programs, and it does
<em>not</em> apply when you set the region any other way, including
shift-selection (see <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>).

   <p><a name="index-Delete-Selection-mode-1183"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Delete-Selection-1184"></a><a name="index-delete_002dselection_002dmode-1185"></a>  Many graphical applications also follow the convention that
insertion while text is selected deletes the selected text.  You can
make Emacs behave this way by enabling Delete Selection mode.
