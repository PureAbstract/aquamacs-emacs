<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.3.4 Features of the Log Entry Buffer</h5>

<p>When you check in changes, Emacs pops up a buffer called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; for you to enter a log entry.

   <p>After you have finished editing the log message, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
to exit the buffer and commit the change.

   <p><a name="index-log_002dedit_002dshow_002dfiles-2448"></a><a name="index-log_002dedit_002dshow_002ddiff-2449"></a>  In the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, typing <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd>
(<code>log-edit-show-files</code>) displays a list of files in the VC
fileset you are committing.  If you called <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> directly from
a work file, the VC fileset consists of that single file, so this
command is not very useful.  If you called <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> from a VC
directory buffer, the VC fileset may consist of multiple files
(see <a href="VC-Directory-Mode.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>).

   <p><a name="index-log_002dedit_002dinsert_002dchangelog-2450"></a>  Type <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> (<code>log-edit-show-diff</code>) to show a &ldquo;diff&rdquo; of
the changes you have made (i.e., the differences between the work file
and the repository revision from which you started editing the file). 
The diff is displayed in a special buffer in another window. 
See <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>.

   <p>If you have written an entry in the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> (see <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>), type <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd> (<code>log-edit-insert-changelog</code>) to pull
it into the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.  If the topmost item in the
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> was made under your user name on the current date,
this command searches that item for entries that match the file(s) to
be committed; if found, these entries are inserted. 
See <a href="Change-Logs-and-VC.html#Change-Logs-and-VC">Change Logs and VC</a>,
for the opposite way of working&mdash;generating ChangeLog entries from
the revision control log.

   <p>To abort a check-in, just <strong>don't</strong> type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> in that
buffer.  You can switch buffers and do other editing.  As long as you
don't try to check in another file, the entry you were editing remains
in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, and you can go back to that buffer at
any time to complete the check-in.

   <p>If you change several source files for the same reason, it is often
convenient to specify the same log entry for many of the files.  (This
is the normal way to do things on a changeset-oriented system, where
comments are attached to changesets rather than the history of
individual files.)  The most convenient way to do this is to mark all
the files in VC Directory Mode and check in from there; the log buffer
will carry the fileset information with it and do a group commit when
you type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>.

   <p>You can also browse the history of previous log entries to duplicate
a checkin comment. This can be useful when you want several files to
have checkin comments that vary only slightly from each other. The
commands <kbd>M-n</kbd>, <kbd>M-p</kbd>, <kbd>M-s</kbd> and <kbd>M-r</kbd> for doing this
work just like the minibuffer history commands (except that these
versions are used outside the minibuffer).

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dlog_002dmode_002dhook-2451"></a>  Each time you check in a change, the log entry buffer is put into VC
Log Edit mode, which involves running two hooks: <code>text-mode-hook</code>
and <code>vc-log-mode-hook</code>.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.
