<h3 class="section">30.11 Other Features Useful for Editing Programs</h3>

<p>A number of Emacs commands that aren't designed specifically for
editing programs are useful for that nonetheless.

   <p>The Emacs commands that operate on words, sentences and paragraphs
are useful for editing code.  Most symbols names contain words
(see <a href="Words.html#Words">Words</a>); sentences can be found in strings and comments
(see <a href="Sentences.html#Sentences">Sentences</a>).  Paragraphs in the strict sense can be found in
program code (in long comments), but the paragraph commands are useful
in other places too, because programming language major modes define
paragraphs to begin and end at blank lines (see <a href="Paragraphs.html#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>). 
Judicious use of blank lines to make the program clearer will also
provide useful chunks of text for the paragraph commands to work on. 
Auto Fill mode, if enabled in a programming language major mode,
indents the new lines which it creates.

   <p>The selective display feature is useful for looking at the overall
structure of a function (see <a href="Selective-Display.html#Selective-Display">Selective Display</a>).  This feature
hides the lines that are indented more than a specified amount. 
Programming modes often support Outline minor mode (see <a href="Outline-Mode.html#Outline-Mode">Outline Mode</a>).  The Foldout package provides folding-editor features
(see <a href="Foldout.html#Foldout">Foldout</a>).

   <p>The &ldquo;automatic typing&rdquo; features may be useful for writing programs. 
See <a href="../autotype/index.html#Top">Autotyping</a>.
