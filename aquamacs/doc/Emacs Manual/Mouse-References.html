<h3 class="section">25.2 Following References with the Mouse</h3>

<p><a name="index-Mouse_002d1-_0040r_007b_0028selection_0029_007d-1212"></a><a name="index-Mouse_002d2-_0040r_007b_0028selection_0029_007d-1213"></a>
<a name="index-mouse_002dhighlight-1214"></a>  Some Emacs buffers include <dfn>buttons</dfn>.  A button is a piece of
text that performs some action when you activate it, such as following
a reference.  Usually, a button's text is visually highlighted: it is
underlined, or a box is drawn around it.  If you move the mouse over a
button, the shape of the mouse cursor changes and the button lights up
(if you change the variable <code>mouse-highlight</code> to <code>nil</code>,
Emacs disables this highlighting).

   <p>You can activate a button by moving point to it and typing
&lt;RET&gt;, or by clicking either <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> or <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> on the
button.  For example, typing &lt;RET&gt; or clicking on a file name in a
Dired buffer visits that file (see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).  Doing it on an error
message in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Compilation*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer goes to the source code for
that error message (see <a href="Compilation.html#Compilation">Compilation</a>).  Doing it on a completion in
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Completions*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer chooses that completion
(see <a href="Completion.html#Completion">Completion</a>).

   <p>Although clicking <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> on a button usually activates that
button, if you hold the mouse button down for a short period of time
before releasing it (specifically, for more than 450 milliseconds),
then Emacs moves point where you clicked instead.  This behavior
allows you to use the mouse to move point over a button without
following it.  Dragging&mdash;moving the mouse while it is held down&mdash;has
its usual behavior of setting the region, even if you drag from or
onto a button.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002d1_002dclick_002din_002dnon_002dselected_002dwindows-1215"></a>  Normally, clicking <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> on a button activates the button
even if it is in a nonselected window.  If you change the variable
<code>mouse-1-click-in-non-selected-windows</code> to <code>nil</code>, clicking
<kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> on a button in an un-selected window moves point to the
clicked position and selects that window, without activating the
button.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002d1_002dclick_002dfollows_002dlink-1216"></a>  In Emacs versions before 22, only <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> activates buttons
and <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> always sets point.  If you prefer this older
behavior, set the variable <code>mouse-1-click-follows-link</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  This variable also lets you choose various other
alternatives for following links with the mouse.  Type <kbd>C-h v
mouse-1-click-follows-link &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> for more details.
