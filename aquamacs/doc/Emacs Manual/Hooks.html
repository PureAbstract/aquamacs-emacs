<h4 class="subsection">57.3.2 Hooks</h4>

<p><a name="index-hook-3977"></a><a name="index-running-a-hook-3978"></a>
  <dfn>Hooks</dfn> are an important mechanism for customizing Emacs.  A
hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called
on some well-defined occasion.  (This is called <dfn>running the
hook</dfn>.)  The individual functions in the list are called the <dfn>hook
functions</dfn> of the hook.  With rare exceptions, hooks in Emacs are
empty when Emacs starts up, so the only hook functions in any given
hook are the ones you explicitly put there as customization.

   <p>Most major modes run one or more <dfn>mode hooks</dfn> as the last step
of initialization.  This makes it easy for you to customize the
behavior of the mode, by setting up a hook function to override the
local variable assignments already made by the mode.  But hooks are
also used in other contexts.  For example, the hook
<code>kill-emacs-hook</code> runs just before quitting the Emacs job
(see <a href="Exiting.html#Exiting">Exiting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-normal-hook-3979"></a>  Most Emacs hooks are <dfn>normal hooks</dfn>.  This means that running the
hook operates by calling all the hook functions, unconditionally, with
no arguments.  We have made an effort to keep most hooks normal so that
you can use them in a uniform way.  Every variable in Emacs whose name
ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo; is a normal hook.

   <p><a name="index-abnormal-hook-3980"></a>  There are also a few <dfn>abnormal hooks</dfn>.  These variables' names end
in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hooks</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>&rsquo;, instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;.  What
makes these hooks abnormal is that there is something peculiar about the
way its functions are called&mdash;perhaps they are given arguments, or
perhaps the values they return are used in some way.  For example,
<code>find-file-not-found-functions</code> (see <a href="Visiting.html#Visiting">Visiting</a>) is abnormal because
as soon as one hook function returns a non-<code>nil</code> value, the rest
are not called at all.  The documentation of each abnormal hook variable
explains in detail what is peculiar about it.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dhook-3981"></a>  You can set a hook variable with <code>setq</code> like any other Lisp
variable, but the recommended way to add a hook function to a hook
(either normal or abnormal) is by calling <code>add-hook</code>. 
See <a href="../elisp/Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

   <p>For example, here's how to set up a hook to turn on Auto Fill mode
when entering Text mode and other modes based on Text mode:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
</pre>
   <p>The next example shows how to use a hook to customize the indentation
of C code.  (People often have strong personal preferences for one
format compared to another.)  Here the hook function is an anonymous
lambda expression.

<pre class="example">     (setq my-c-style
       '((c-comment-only-line-offset . 4)
         (c-cleanup-list . (scope-operator
     		       empty-defun-braces
     		       defun-close-semi))
         (c-offsets-alist . ((arglist-close . c-lineup-arglist)
     			(substatement-open . 0)))))
     
     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
       '(lambda ()
          (c-add-style "my-style" my-c-style t)))
</pre>
   <p>It is best to design your hook functions so that the order in which
they are executed does not matter.  Any dependence on the order is
&ldquo;asking for trouble.&rdquo;  However, the order is predictable: the most
recently added hook functions are executed first.

   <p><a name="index-remove_002dhook-3982"></a>  If you play with adding various different versions of a hook
function by calling <code>add-hook</code> over and over, remember that all
the versions you added will remain in the hook variable together.  You
can clear out individual functions by calling <code>remove-hook</code>, or
do <code>(setq </code><var>hook-variable</var><code> nil)</code> to remove everything.
