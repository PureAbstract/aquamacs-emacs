<h3 class="section">2.7 Plain lists</h3>

<p><a name="index-plain-lists-120"></a><a name="index-lists_002c-plain-121"></a><a name="index-lists_002c-ordered-122"></a><a name="index-ordered-lists-123"></a>
Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (see <a href="Checkboxes.html#Checkboxes">Checkboxes</a>).  Org supports editing such lists,
and the HTML exporter (see <a href="Exporting.html#Exporting">Exporting</a>) parses and formats them.

   <p>Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.
     <ul>
<li><em>Unordered</em> list items start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
as bullets. 
<li><em>Ordered</em> list items start with a numeral followed by either a period or
a right parenthesis, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<li><em>Description</em> list items are unordered list items, and contain the
separator &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp"> :: </span></samp>&rsquo; to separate the description <em>term</em> from the
description. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-org_002dempty_002dline_002dterminates_002dplain_002dlists-124"></a>Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on the first
line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10.</span></samp>&rsquo;, then the
2&ndash;digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the other numbers in the
list.  Indentation also determines the end of a list item.  It ends before
the next line that is indented like the bullet/number, or less.  Empty lines
are part of the previous item, so you can have several paragraphs in one
item.  If you would like an empty line to terminate all currently open plain
lists, configure the variable <code>org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists</code>. 
Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     ** Lord of the Rings
        My favorite scenes are (in this order)
        1. The attack of the Rohirrim
        2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
           + this was already my favorite scene in the book
           + I really like Miranda Otto.
        3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
            - on DVD only
           He makes a really funny face when it happens.
        But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
        Important actors in this film are:
        - <b>Elijah Wood</b> :: He plays Frodo
        - <b>Sean Austin</b> :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
          him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in <i>The Goonies</i>.
</pre>
   <p>Org supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to deal with
them correctly<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and by exporting them
properly (see <a href="Exporting.html#Exporting">Exporting</a>).  Since indentation is what governs the
structure of these lists, many structural constructs like <code>#+BEGIN_...</code>
blocks can be indented to signal that they should be part of a list item.

   <p>The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first line
of an item (the line with the bullet or number).

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bTAB_007d-125"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-org_002dcycle_002dinclude_002dplain_002dlists-126"></a>Items can be folded just like headline levels.  Normally this works only if
the cursor is on a plain list item.  For more details, see the variable
<code>org-cycle-include-plain-lists</code>. to <code>integrate</code>, plain list items
will be treated like low-level.  The level of an item is then given by the
indentation of the bullet/number.  Items are always subordinate to real
headlines, however; the hierarchies remain completely separated.

     <p>If <code>org-cycle-include-plain-lists</code> has not been set, &lt;TAB&gt;
fixes the indentation of the current line in a heuristic way. 
<a name="index-M_002d_0040key_007bRET_007d-127"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-org_002dM_002dRET_002dmay_002dsplit_002dline-128"></a>Insert new item at current level.  With a prefix argument, force a new
heading (see <a href="Structure-editing.html#Structure-editing">Structure editing</a>).  If this command is used in the middle
of a line, the line is <em>split</em> and the rest of the line becomes the new
item<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  If this command is executed in the
<em>whitespace before a bullet or number</em>, the new item is created
<em>before</em> the current item.  If the command is executed in the white
space before the text that is part of an item but does not contain the
bullet, a bullet is added to the current line. 
<a name="index-M_002dS_002d_0040key_007bRET_007d-129"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-S-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Insert a new item with a checkbox (see <a href="Checkboxes.html#Checkboxes">Checkboxes</a>). 
<a name="index-g_t_0040key_007bTAB_007d-130"></a><br><dt><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt; </kbd><span class="roman">in new, empty item</span><dd>In a new item with no text yet, the first &lt;TAB&gt; demotes the item to
become a child of the previous one.  The next &lt;TAB&gt; makes it a parent,
and so on, all the way to the left margin.  Yet another &lt;TAB&gt;, and you
are back to the initial level. 
<a name="index-S_002d_0040key_007bup_007d-131"></a><a name="index-S_002d_0040key_007bdown_007d-132"></a><br><dt><kbd>S-&lt;up&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>S-&lt;down&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-shift_002dselection_002dmode-133"></a><a name="index-org_002dsupport_002dshift_002dselect-134"></a>Jump to the previous/next item in the current list, but only if
<code>org-support-shift-select</code> is off.  If not, you can still use paragraph
jumping commands like <kbd>C-&lt;up&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>C-&lt;down&gt;</kbd> to quite
similar effect. 
<a name="index-M_002dS_002d_0040key_007bup_007d-135"></a><a name="index-M_002dS_002d_0040key_007bdown_007d-136"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-S-&lt;up&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>M-S-&lt;down&gt;</kbd><dd>Move the item including subitems up/down (swap with previous/next item
of same indentation).  If the list is ordered, renumbering is
automatic. 
<a name="index-M_002dS_002d_0040key_007bleft_007d-137"></a><a name="index-M_002dS_002d_0040key_007bright_007d-138"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-S-&lt;left&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>M-S-&lt;right&gt;</kbd><dd>Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems. 
Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation. 
When these commands are executed several times in direct succession,
the initially selected region is used, even if the new indentation
would imply a different hierarchy.  To use the new hierarchy, break
the command chain with a cursor motion or so. 
<a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dc-139"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-c C-c</kbd><dd>If there is a checkbox (see <a href="Checkboxes.html#Checkboxes">Checkboxes</a>) in the item line, toggle the
state of the checkbox.  If not, this command makes sure that all the
items on this list level use the same bullet.  Furthermore, if this is
an ordered list, make sure the numbering is OK. 
<a name="index-C_002dc-_002d-140"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-c -</kbd><dd>Cycle the entire list level through the different itemize/enumerate bullets
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1)</span></samp>&rsquo;).  With a numeric prefix
argument N, select the Nth bullet from this list.  If there is an active
region when calling this, all lines will be converted to list items.  If the
first line already was a list item, any item markers will be removed from the
list.  Finally, even without an active region, a normal line will be
converted into a list item. 
<a name="index-C_002dc-_002a-141"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-c *</kbd><dd>Turn a plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a subheading at
its location). See <a href="Structure-editing.html#Structure-editing">Structure editing</a>, for a detailed explanation. 
<a name="index-S_002d_0040key_007bleft_007d-142"></a><a name="index-S_002d_0040key_007bright_007d-143"></a><br><dt><kbd>S-&lt;left&gt;/&lt;right&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-org_002dsupport_002dshift_002dselect-144"></a>This command also cycles bullet styles when the cursor in on the bullet or
anywhere in an item line, details depending on
<code>org-support-shift-select</code>. 
<a name="index-C_002dc-_005e-145"></a><br><dt><kbd>C-c ^</kbd><dd>Sort the plain list.  You will be prompted for the sorting method:
numerically, alphabetically, by time, or by custom function.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> When using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; as a bullet, lines must be indented or
they will be seen as top-level headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a star are
visually indistinguishable from true headlines.  In short: even though
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain list items.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> Org only changes the filling settings for Emacs.  For
XEmacs, you should use Kyle E. Jones' <samp><span class="file">filladapt.el</span></samp>.  To turn this on,
put into <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp>: <code>(require 'filladapt)</code></p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> If you do not want the line to be split, customize the variable
<code>org-M-RET-may-split-line</code>.</p>
