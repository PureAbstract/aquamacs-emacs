<h3 class="section">7.7 Refinement of Difference Regions</h3>

<p>Ediff has variables to control the way fine differences are
highlighted.  This feature gives you control over the process of refinement. 
Note that refinement ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines.

     <dl>
<dt><code>ediff-auto-refine</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dauto_002drefine-186"></a>This variable controls whether fine differences within regions are
highlighted automatically (&ldquo;auto-refining&rdquo;).  The default is yes
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <p>On a slow machine, automatic refinement may be painful.  In that case,
you can turn auto-refining on or off interactively by typing
<kbd>@</kbd>.  You can also turn off display of refining that has
already been done.

     <p>When auto-refining is off, fine differences are shown only for regions
for which these differences have been computed and saved before.  If
auto-refining and display of refining are both turned off, fine
differences are not shown at all.

     <p>Typing <kbd>*</kbd> computes and displays fine differences for the current
difference region, regardless of whether auto-refining is turned on.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-auto-refine-limit</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dauto_002drefine_002dlimit-187"></a>If auto-refining is on, this variable limits the size of the regions to
be auto-refined.  This guards against the possible slowdown that may be
caused by extraordinary large difference regions.

     <p>You can always refine the current region by typing <kbd>*</kbd>.

     <br><dt><code>ediff-forward-word-function</code><dd><a name="index-ediff_002dforward_002dword_002dfunction-188"></a>This variable controls how fine differences are computed.  The
value must be a Lisp function that determines how the current difference
region should be split into words.

     <p><a name="index-ediff_002ddiff_002dprogram-189"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dforward_002dword_002dfunction-190"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dforward_002dword-191"></a>Fine differences are computed by first splitting the current difference
region into words and then passing the result to
<code>ediff-diff-program</code>.  For the default forward word function (which is
<code>ediff-forward-word</code>), a word is a string consisting of letters,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_</span></samp>&rsquo;; a string of punctuation symbols; a string of digits,
or a string consisting of symbols that are neither space, nor a letter.

     <p>This default behavior is controlled by four variables: <code>ediff-word-1</code>,
..., <code>ediff-word-4</code>.  See the on-line documentation for these variables
and for the function <code>ediff-forward-word</code> for an explanation of how to
modify these variables. 
<a name="index-ediff_002dword_002d1-192"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dword_002d2-193"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dword_002d3-194"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dword_002d4-195"></a></dl>

   <p>Sometimes, when a region has too many differences between the variants,
highlighting of fine differences is inconvenient, especially on
color displays.  If that is the case, type <kbd>*</kbd> with a negative
prefix argument.  This unhighlights fine differences for the current
region.

   <p>To unhighlight fine differences in all difference regions, use the
command <kbd>@</kbd>.  Repeated typing of this key cycles through three
different states: auto-refining, no-auto-refining, and no-highlighting
of fine differences.
