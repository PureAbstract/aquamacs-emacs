<h3 class="section">3.1 Quick Help Commands</h3>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>?</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_003f-46"></a>Toggles the Ediff Quick Help window ON and OFF. 
<br><dt><kbd>G</kbd><dd><a name="index-G-47"></a>Prepares a mail buffer for sending a praise or a curse to the Ediff maintainer.

     <br><dt><kbd>E</kbd><dd><a name="index-E-48"></a>Brings up the top node of this manual, where you can find further
information on the various Ediff functions and advanced issues, such as
customization, session groups, etc.

     <br><dt><kbd>v</kbd><dd><a name="index-v-49"></a>Scrolls up buffers A and B (and buffer C where appropriate) in a
coordinated fashion. 
<br><dt><kbd>V</kbd><dd><a name="index-V-50"></a>Scrolls the buffers down.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_003c-51"></a>Scrolls the buffers to the left simultaneously. 
<br><dt><kbd>&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_003e-52"></a>Scrolls buffers to the right.

     <br><dt><kbd>wd</kbd><dd><a name="index-wd-53"></a>Saves the output from the diff utility, for further reference.

     <p>With prefix argument, saves the plain output from <code>diff</code> (see
<code>ediff-diff-program</code> and <code>ediff-diff-options</code>).  Without the
argument, it saves customized <code>diff</code> output (see
<code>ediff-custom-diff-program</code> and <code>ediff-custom-diff-options</code>), if
it is available.

     <br><dt><kbd>wa</kbd><dd><a name="index-wa-54"></a>Saves buffer A, if it was modified. 
<br><dt><kbd>wb</kbd><dd><a name="index-wb-55"></a>Saves buffer B, if it was modified. 
<br><dt><kbd>wc</kbd><dd><a name="index-wc-56"></a>Saves buffer C, if it was modified (if you are in a session that
compares three files simultaneously).

     <br><dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd><a name="index-a-57"></a><em>In comparison sessions:</em>
Copies the current difference region (or the region specified as the prefix
to this command) from buffer A to buffer B. 
Ediff saves the old contents of buffer B's region; it can
be restored via the command <kbd>rb</kbd>, which see.

     <p><em>In merge sessions:</em>
Copies the current difference region (or the region specified as the prefix
to this command) from buffer A to the merge buffer.  The old contents of
this region in buffer C can be restored via the command <kbd>r</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>b</kbd><dd><a name="index-b-58"></a>Works similarly, but copies the current difference region from buffer B to
buffer A (in <em>comparison sessions</em>) or the merge buffer (in
<em>merge sessions</em>).

     <p>Ediff saves the old contents of the difference region copied over; it can
be reinstated via the command <kbd>ra</kbd> in comparison sessions and
<kbd>r</kbd> in merge sessions.

     <br><dt><kbd>ab</kbd><dd><a name="index-ab-59"></a>Copies the current difference region (or the region specified as the prefix
to this command) from buffer A to buffer B.  This (and the next five)
command is enabled only in sessions that compare three files
simultaneously.  The old region in buffer B is saved and can be restored
via the command <kbd>rb</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>ac</kbd><dd><a name="index-ac-60"></a>Copies the difference region from buffer A to buffer C. 
The old region in buffer C is saved and can be restored via the command
<kbd>rc</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>ba</kbd><dd><a name="index-ba-61"></a>Copies the difference region from buffer B to buffer A. 
The old region in buffer A is saved and can be restored via the command
<kbd>ra</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>bc</kbd><dd><a name="index-bc-62"></a>Copies the difference region from buffer B to buffer C. 
The command <kbd>rc</kbd> undoes this. 
<br><dt><kbd>ca</kbd><dd><a name="index-ca-63"></a>Copies the difference region from buffer C to buffer A. 
The command <kbd>ra</kbd> undoes this. 
<br><dt><kbd>cb</kbd><dd><a name="index-cb-64"></a>Copies the difference region from buffer C to buffer B. 
The command <kbd>rb</kbd> undoes this.

     <br><dt><kbd>p</kbd><dt><kbd>DEL</kbd><dd><a name="index-p-65"></a><a name="index-DEL-66"></a>Makes the previous difference region current. 
<br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dt><kbd>SPC</kbd><dd><a name="index-n-67"></a><a name="index-SPC-68"></a>Makes the next difference region current.

     <br><dt><kbd>j</kbd><dt><kbd>-j</kbd><dt><kbd>Nj</kbd><dd><a name="index-j-69"></a>Makes the very first difference region current.

     <p><kbd>-j</kbd> makes the last region current.  Typing a number, N, and then `j'
makes the difference region N current.  Typing -N (a negative number) then
`j' makes current the region Last - N.

     <br><dt><kbd>ga</kbd><dd><a name="index-ga-70"></a>Makes current the difference region closest to the position of the point in
buffer A.

     <p>However, with a prefix argument, Ediff would position all variants
around the area indicated by the current point in buffer A: if
the point is inside a difference region, then the variants will be
positioned at this difference region.  If the point is not in any difference
region, then it is in an area where all variants agree with each other.  In
this case, the variants will be positioned so that each would display this
area (of agreement). 
<br><dt><kbd>gb</kbd><dd><a name="index-gb-71"></a>Makes current the difference region closest to the position of the point in
buffer B.

     <p>With a prefix argument, behaves like <kbd>ga</kbd>, but with respect to buffer B. 
<br><dt><kbd>gc</kbd><dd><a name="index-gc-72"></a><em>In merge sessions:</em>
makes current the difference region closest to the point in the merge buffer.

     <p><em>In 3-file comparison sessions:</em>
makes current the region closest to the point in buffer C.

     <p>With a prefix argument, behaves like <kbd>ga</kbd>, but with respect to buffer C.

     <br><dt><kbd>!</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0021-73"></a>Recomputes the difference regions, bringing them up to date.  This is often
needed because it is common to do all sorts of editing during Ediff
sessions, so after a while, the highlighted difference regions may no
longer reflect the actual differences among the buffers.

     <br><dt><kbd>*</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_002a-74"></a>Forces refinement of the current difference region, which highlights the exact
words of disagreement among the buffers.  With a negative prefix argument,
unhighlights the current region.

     <p>Forceful refinement may be needed if Ediff encounters a difference region
that is larger than <code>ediff-auto-refine-limit</code>.  In this situation,
Ediff doesn't do automatic refinement in order to improve response time. 
(Ediff doesn't auto-refine on dumb terminals as well, but <kbd>*</kbd> still
works there.  However, the only useful piece of information it can tell you
is whether or not the difference regions disagree only in the amount of
white space.)

     <p>This command is also useful when the highlighted fine differences are
no longer current, due to user editing.

     <br><dt><kbd>m</kbd><dd><a name="index-m-75"></a>Displays the current Ediff session in a frame as wide as the physical
display.  This is useful when comparing files side-by-side.  Typing `m' again
restores the original size of the frame.

     <br><dt><kbd>|</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_007c-76"></a>Toggles the horizontal/vertical split of the Ediff display.  Horizontal
split is convenient when it is possible to compare files
side-by-side.  If the frame in which files are displayed is too narrow
and lines are cut off, typing <kbd>m</kbd> may help some.

     <br><dt><kbd>@</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040_0040-77"></a>Toggles auto-refinement of difference regions (i.e., automatic highlighting
of the exact words that differ among the variants).  Auto-refinement is
turned off on devices where Emacs doesn't support highlighting.

     <p>On slow machines, it may be advantageous to turn auto-refinement off.  The
user can always forcefully refine specific difference regions by typing
<kbd>*</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>h</kbd><dd><a name="index-h-78"></a>Cycles between full highlighting, the mode where fine differences are not
highlighted (but computed), and the mode where highlighting is done with
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> strings.  The latter is not really recommended, unless on a dumb TTY.

     <br><dt><kbd>r</kbd><dd><a name="index-r-79"></a>Restores the old contents of the region in the merge buffer. 
(If you copied a difference region from buffer A or B into the merge buffer
using the commands <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>b</kbd>, Ediff saves the old contents of the
region in case you change your mind.)

     <p>This command is enabled in merge sessions only.

     <br><dt><kbd>ra</kbd><dd><a name="index-ra-80"></a>Restores the old contents of the current difference region in buffer A,
which was previously saved when the user invoked one of these commands:
<kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>ba</kbd>, <kbd>ca</kbd>, which see.  This command is enabled in
comparison sessions only. 
<br><dt><kbd>rb</kbd><dd><a name="index-rb-81"></a>Restores the old contents of the current difference region in buffer B,
which was previously saved when the user invoked one of these commands:
<kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>ab</kbd>, <kbd>cb</kbd>, which see.  This command is enabled in
comparison sessions only. 
<br><dt><kbd>rc</kbd><dd><a name="index-rc-82"></a>Restores the old contents of the current difference region in buffer C,
which was previously saved when the user invoked one of these commands:
<kbd>ac</kbd>, <kbd>bc</kbd>, which see.  This command is enabled in 3-file
comparison sessions only.

     <br><dt><kbd>##</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0023_0023-83"></a>Tell Ediff to skip over regions that disagree among themselves only in the
amount of white space and line breaks.

     <p>Even though such regions will be skipped over, you can still jump to any
one of them by typing the region number and then `j'.  Typing <kbd>##</kbd>
again puts Ediff back in the original state.

     <br><dt><kbd>#c</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0023c-84"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dignore_002dcase_002doption-85"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dignore_002dcase_002doption3-86"></a><a name="index-ediff_002dignore_002dcase-87"></a>Toggle case sensitivity in the diff program. All diffs are recomputed. 
Case sensitivity is controlled by the variables
<code>ediff-ignore-case-option</code>, <code>ediff-ignore-case-option3</code>,
and <code>ediff-ignore-case</code>, which are explained elsewhere.

     <br><dt><kbd>#h</kbd><dt><kbd>#f</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0023f-88"></a><a name="index-g_t_0023h-89"></a>Ediff works hard to ameliorate the effects of boredom in the workplace...

     <p>Quite often differences are due to identical replacements (e.g., the word
`foo' is replaced with the word `bar' everywhere).  If the number of regions
with such boring differences exceeds your tolerance threshold, you may be
tempted to tell Ediff to skip these regions altogether (you will still be able
to jump to them via the command <kbd>j</kbd>).  The above commands, <kbd>#h</kbd>
and <kbd>#f</kbd>, may well save your day!

     <p><kbd>#h</kbd> prompts you to specify regular expressions for each
variant.  Difference regions where each variant's region matches the
corresponding regular expression will be skipped from then on.  (You can
also tell Ediff to skip regions where at least one variant matches its
regular expression.)

     <p><kbd>#f</kbd> does dual job: it focuses on regions that match the corresponding
regular expressions.  All other regions will be skipped
over.  See <a href="Selective-Browsing.html#Selective-Browsing">Selective Browsing</a>, for more.

     <br><dt><kbd>A</kbd><dd><a name="index-A-90"></a>Toggles the read-only property in buffer A. 
If file A is under version control and is checked in, it is checked out
(with your permission). 
<br><dt><kbd>B</kbd><dd><a name="index-B-91"></a>Toggles the read-only property in buffer B. 
If file B is under version control and is checked in, it is checked out. 
<br><dt><kbd>C</kbd><dd><a name="index-C-92"></a>Toggles the read-only property in buffer C (in 3-file comparison sessions). 
If file C is under version control and is checked in, it is checked out.

     <br><dt><kbd>~</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_007e-93"></a>Swaps the windows where buffers A and B are displayed.  If you are comparing
three buffers at once, then this command would rotate the windows among
buffers A, B, and C.

     <br><dt><kbd>i</kbd><dd><a name="index-i-94"></a>Displays all kinds of useful data about the current Ediff session. 
<br><dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd><a name="index-D-95"></a>Runs <code>ediff-custom-diff-program</code> on the variants and displays the
buffer containing the output.  This is useful when you must send the output
to your Mom.

     <p>With a prefix argument, displays the plain <code>diff</code> output. 
See <a href="Patch-and-Diff-Programs.html#Patch-and-Diff-Programs">Patch and Diff Programs</a>, for details.

     <br><dt><kbd>R</kbd><dd><a name="index-R-96"></a>Displays a list of currently active Ediff sessions&mdash;the Ediff Registry. 
You can then restart any of these sessions by either clicking on a session
record or by putting the cursor over it and then typing the return key.

     <p>(Some poor souls leave so many active Ediff sessions around that they lose
track of them completely...  The `R' command is designed to save these
people from the recently discovered Ediff Proficiency Syndrome.)

     <p>Typing <kbd>R</kbd> brings up Ediff Registry only if it is typed into an Ediff
Control Panel.  If you don't have a control panel handy, type this in the
minibuffer: <kbd>M-x eregistry</kbd>.  See <a href="Registry-of-Ediff-Sessions.html#Registry-of-Ediff-Sessions">Registry of Ediff Sessions</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>M</kbd><dd><a name="index-M-97"></a>Shows the session group buffer that invoked the current Ediff session. 
See <a href="Session-Groups.html#Session-Groups">Session Groups</a>, for more information on session groups.

     <br><dt><kbd>z</kbd><dd><a name="index-z-98"></a>Suspends the current Ediff session.  (If you develop a condition known as
Repetitive Ediff Injury&mdash;a serious but curable illness&mdash;you must change
your current activity.  This command tries hard to hide all Ediff-related
buffers.)

     <p>The easiest way to resume a suspended Ediff session is through the registry
of active sessions.  See <a href="Registry-of-Ediff-Sessions.html#Registry-of-Ediff-Sessions">Registry of Ediff Sessions</a>, for details. 
<br><dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd><a name="index-q-99"></a>Terminates this Ediff session.  With a prefix argument (e.g.,<kbd>1q</kbd>), asks
if you also want to delete the buffers of the variants. 
Modified files and the results of merges are never deleted.

     <br><dt><kbd>%</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0025-100"></a>Toggles narrowing in Ediff buffers.  Ediff buffers may be narrowed if you
are comparing only parts of these buffers via the commands
<code>ediff-windows-*</code> and <code>ediff-regions-*</code>, which see.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-l</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dl-101"></a>Restores the usual Ediff window setup.  This is the quickest way to resume
an Ediff session, but it works only if the control panel of that session is
visible.

     <br><dt><kbd>$$</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0024_0024-102"></a>While merging with an ancestor file, Ediff is determined to reduce user's
wear and tear by saving him and her much of unproductive, repetitive
typing.  If it notices that, say, file A's difference region is identical to
the same difference region in the ancestor file, then the merge buffer will
automatically get the difference region taken from buffer B.  The rationale
is that this difference region in buffer A is as old as that in the
ancestor buffer, so the contents of that region in buffer B represents real
change.

     <p>You may want to ignore such `obvious' merges and concentrate on difference
regions where both files `clash' with the ancestor, since this means that
two different people have been changing this region independently and they
had different ideas on how to do this.

     <p>The above command does this for you by skipping the regions where only one
of the variants clashes with the ancestor but the other variant agrees with
it.  Typing <kbd>$$</kbd> again undoes this setting.

     <br><dt><kbd>$*</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0024_002a-103"></a>When merging files with large number of differences, it is sometimes
convenient to be able to skip the difference regions for which you already
decided which variant is most appropriate. Typing <kbd>$*</kbd> will accomplish
precisely this.

     <p>To be more precise, this toggles the check for whether the current merge is
identical to its default setting, as originally decided by Ediff.  For
instance, if Ediff is merging according to the `combined' policy, then the
merge region is skipped over if it is different from the combination of the
regions in buffers A and B.  (Warning: swapping buffers A and B will confuse
things in this respect.)  If the merge region is marked as `prefer-A' then
this region will be skipped if it differs from the current difference
region in buffer A, etc.

     <br><dt><kbd>/</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_002f-104"></a>Displays the ancestor file during merges. 
<br><dt><kbd>&amp;</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_0026-105"></a>In some situations, such as when one of the files agrees with the ancestor file
on a difference region and the other doesn't, Ediff knows what to do: it copies
the current difference region from the second buffer into the merge buffer.

     <p>In other cases, the right course of action is not that clearcut, and Ediff
would use a default action.  The above command changes the default action. 
The default action can be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">default-A</span></samp>&rsquo; (choose the region from buffer
A), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">default-B</span></samp>&rsquo; (choose the region from buffer B), or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">combined</span></samp>&rsquo;
(combine the regions from the two buffers). 
See <a href="Merging-and-diff3.html#Merging-and-diff3">Merging and diff3</a>, for further details.

     <p>The command <kbd>&amp;</kbd> also affects the regions in the merge buffers that have
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">default-A</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">default-B</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">combined</span></samp>&rsquo; status, provided
they weren't changed with respect to the original.  For instance, if such a
region has the status &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">default-A</span></samp>&rsquo; then changing the default action to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">default-B</span></samp>&rsquo; will also replace this merge-buffer's region with the
corresponding region from buffer B.

     <br><dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd><a name="index-s-106"></a>Causes the merge window shrink to its minimum size, thereby exposing as much
of the variant buffers as possible.  Typing `s' again restores
the original size of that window.

     <p>With a positive prefix argument, this command enlarges the merge window. 
E.g., <kbd>4s</kbd> increases the size of the window by about 4 lines, if
possible.  With a negative numeric argument, the size of the merge window
shrinks by that many lines, if possible.  Thus, <kbd>-s</kbd> shrinks the window
by about 1 line and <kbd>-3s</kbd> by about 3 lines.

     <p>This command is intended only for temporary viewing; therefore, Ediff
restores window C to its original size whenever it makes any other change
in the window configuration.  However, redisplaying (<kbd>C-l</kbd>) or jumping
to another difference does not affect window C's size.

     <p>The split between the merge window and the variant windows is controlled by
the variable <code>ediff-merge-window-share</code>, which see.

     <br><dt><kbd>+</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_002b-107"></a>Combines the difference regions from buffers A and B and copies the
result into the merge buffer.  See <a href="Merging-and-diff3.html#Merging-and-diff3">Merging and diff3</a>, and the
variables <code>ediff-combine-diffs</code> and <code>ediff-combination-pattern</code>.

     <br><dt><kbd>=</kbd><dd><a name="index-g_t_003d-108"></a>You may run into situations when a large chunk of text in one file has been
edited and then moved to a different place in another file.  In such a case,
these two chunks of text are unlikely to belong to the same difference
region, so the refinement feature of Ediff will not be able to tell you
what exactly differs inside these chunks.  Since eyeballing large pieces of
text is contrary to human nature, Ediff has a special command to help
reduce the risk of developing a cataract.

     <p>In other situations, the currently highlighted region might be big and you
might want to reconcile of them interactively.

     <p>All of this can be done with the above command, <kbd>=</kbd>, which
compares regions within Ediff buffers.  Typing <kbd>=</kbd> creates a
child Ediff session for comparing regions in buffers A, B, or
C as follows.

     <p>First, you will be asked whether you want to compare the fine differences
between the currently highlighted buffers on a word-by-word basis. If you
accept, a child Ediff session will start using the currently highlighted
regions. Ediff will let you step over the differences word-wise.

     <p>If you reject the offer, you will be asked to select regions of your choice.

     <p><em>If you are comparing 2 files or buffers:</em>
Ediff will ask you to select regions in buffers A and B.

     <p><em>If you are comparing 3 files or buffers simultaneously:</em> Ediff will
ask you to choose buffers and then select regions inside those buffers.

     <p><em>If you are merging files or buffers (with or without ancestor):</em>
Ediff will ask you to choose which buffer (A or B) to compare with the
merge buffer and then select regions in those buffers.
