<UL>
<LI>SUMMARY: More bugs and other annoyances 
	have been removed. Opening new frames (for new buffers) is more
	useful now, and frame themes aren't applied when a frame is split
	up. Options are automatically saved across sessions. A new
	customization groups for Emacs-die-hards makes it easier to change
	Aquamacs-specific customization defaults. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Intel: Aquamacs is now available as native version for Mac
	computers with Intel CPU.  Thanks to Jonathan Shea, Mike Bennett
	and Richard Koch for providing compile machines.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Dired in one-buffer-one-frame-mode will show new
	directories and open files in the same frame.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Customize will show new groups etc. in the same frame and window.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>One-Buffer-One-Frame-Mode ("Display Buffers in Separate Frames")
	will now show buffers such as *mail*, *grep*, *shell* in their own
	frames. This also applies if other modes open *...* buffers, such
	as ESS opening an inferior R shell, which previously didn't even
	show in a separate window. One-Buffer-One-Frame-Mode is also better
	documented now and has customization options so you can decide
	which buffers are shown in new frames.	

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Frame-Appearance-Themes reconfigure a frame only if just one
	window is present (or all windows show buffers in the same major
	mode). This should more effectively prevent appearance switching
	when a second window is shown temporarily.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Frame-Appearance-Themes now allow the user to delete all
	mode-specific themes when a default is defined. Hints to select
	"Save Options" are more prominent.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Options are saved automatically upon quitting Aquamacs (it'll
	ask you.) - customize `aquamacs-save-options-on-quit' to
	configure.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Quitting Aquamacs: you won't be asked any more whether to quit
	if modified buffers exist, because at that point you've always already
	been asked to save each modified buffer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs-is-more-than-Emacs is a new customization group
	containing all customization variables whose defaults are changed
	in Aquamacs compared to GNU Emacs or the relevant package.
	This is useful for Emacs veterans who want certain behaviors to be
	more similar to GNU Emacs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bug Reporting is handled fully in the system's default mail
	client again (unless you've set up a different
	`send-mail-function')
	Suggested by Robert Sloan

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Mail composed with the Message package will now be routed
	through the mail client by default (`message-send-mail-function')
	and there is no "From" line. If you run postfix locally, you may
	want to do something like the following in your .emacs or Preferences.el:

<P>
<PRE>
	(setq send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it)
	(setq message-send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it)
	(setq mail-setup-with-from t)
</PRE>

<P>
Alternatively do the same in customization buffers.	

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Toolbar looks prettier now.
	Patch by Kim F. Storm

<P>
</LI>
<LI>`Frame-Appearance-Styles' is the new name for the former `Frame
	Appearance Themes, so they won't be confused with GNU Emacs new
	customization themes. A global minor mode called
	`aquamacs-styles-mode' is now used to switch them on/off.

<P>
Some configuration variables have been renamed: 
	`aquamacs-default-styles' 
	       (was: `aquamacs-mode-specific-default-themes')
	`aquamacs-styles-mode' 
	       (was: `aquamacs-auto-frame-parameters-flag')
	`aquamacs-buffer-default-styles' 
	       (was: `aquamacs-buffer-specific-frame-themes')

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A-Backspace deletes the whole logical line again, not just
	the visual line. A-Shift-Backspace deletes the visual line now.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tilde ~ can now be input on German keyboards with the German
	emulation mode via Option-N.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Frame-positions for individual files are now saved to/loaded
	from a file called frame-positions.el (in&nbsp;/Library/Preferences...)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Help buffers (C-h f, C-h v) for certain Aquamacs functions could
	have links to source code at nonexistant paths.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>site-start.el files in the load path (plug-ins!) aren't loaded
	any longer if there is a file named .ignore in the same path.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix in version 0.9.9: customizations weren't read if
	aquamacs-styles (the former "Frame Appearance Themes" were
	switched off.)
	Reported by Brendan Dixon

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Typing C-x C-f, then A-w made the newly opened frame go
	away, but not the "Find file" prompt, which was quite persistent,
	especially if you didn't know about C-g and the minibuffer. That
	is fixed now. 
	Reported by a number of people.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Setting tool-bar-mode or changing the fringes via the
	Options menu will now affect the default frame style as well, so
	the setting will affect new frames (even if frame appearance
	styles are active). Note that if fringes or tool bar are set in
	.emacs, the customized and saved styles will override your
	settings. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Aquamacs will not ask the user any longer whether to
	save dired buffers and other non-file-buffers upon deleting the
	frame (killing the buffer).
	Reported by Carsten Bormann

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: desktop-mode should be able to restore the desktop on
	startup appropriately. 
	Reported by Rudi Schlatte

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: page-wise scrolling (PgUp/PgDown) with long lines
	scrolls exactly one screen now

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: page-wise scrolling (PgUp/PgDown) will remove the region
	as expected when the cursor moves. Shift-PgUp/PgDown will extend
	the region (and set the mark if neccessary).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: completing-read-multiple didn't work (icomplete+ library
	updated)   

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: frames sometimes didn't open in
	one-buffer-one-frame-mode when the buffer shown was empty.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: In one-buffer-one-frame-mode, Apple-W deletes a window
	or kills a buffer and returns to the next buffer in the buffer
	list (i.e. the previously shown buffer) when the frame wasn't
	created for the particular window / buffer being killed. Think of
	it as a stack of buffers that are shown. Previously, Aquamacs
	always switched to *scratch*.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Preview &amp; Print now works with buffers in Tramp Mode, too.
	Reported by Tim Hodgson

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Fonts (not fontsets) set in default-frame-alist and
	similar variables are not filtered out any more after startup if
	they haven't been explicitly loaded (or applied to a frame, and
	thus, loaded).
	Reported by Konstantinos Efstathiou

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: display copyright message at startup. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: Javascript-mode exchanged for the one borrowed from
	XEmacs. This one will hopefully work better now.
	Suggested by Tom Van Vleck

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Bugfix: ediff-directories interferes less with one-buffer-one-frame-mode.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Compiling: Those who build Aquamacs themselves, note that the
	make-aquamacs script will now produce a complete app bundle
	located in (emacs-path)/mac/Aquamacs. The install-aquamacs script
	only moves the bundle to /Applications. If you make any changes to
	the Aquamacs source code (except for pre-loaded code in
	site-load.el), it is usually sufficient to run 
	"copy-to-app -n". Remember to set the AQUAMACS_ROOT and EMACS_ROOT
	environment variables before using any of these scripts.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A BIG THANKYOU goes to all users who have donated
        (<TT><A NAME="tex2html52"
  HREF="http://aquamacs.org/donate">http://aquamacs.org/donate</A></TT>) in the past months. I'd
        also like to thank all those who tested the beta versions,
        reported bugs and contributed ideas and server space:
        Nathaniel Cunningham, Peter Dyballa, Terry Jones, Jos&#233; Figuera
        O'Farrill, Konrad Podczeck, Robert Sloan and many others.
