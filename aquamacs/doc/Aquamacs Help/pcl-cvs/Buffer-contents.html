The display contains several columns, some of which are optional. 
These columns are, from left to right:

     <ul>
<li>Optionally, the head revision of the file.  This is the latest version
found in the repository.  It might also contain (instead of the head
revision) a sub status which typically gives further information about
how we got to the current state, for example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">patched</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">merged</span></samp>&rsquo;, <small class="dots">...</small>

     <li>An asterisk when the file is <dfn>marked</dfn> (see <a href="Selected-files.html#Selected-files">Selected files</a>).

     <li>The actual status of the file wrt the repository.  See below.

     <li>Optionally, the base revision of the file.  This is the version
which the copy in your working directory is based upon.

     <li>The file name.

   </ul>

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file status</span></samp>&rsquo; field can have the following values:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Modified</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is modified in your working directory, and there was no
modification to the same file in the repository.  This status can have
the following substatus:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">merged</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file was modified in your working directory, and there were
modifications in the repository as well, but they were merged
successfully, without conflict, in your working directory. 
</dl>

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Conflict</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to <var>file</var>
with changes from the repository.  <var>file</var> (the copy in your
working directory) is now the output of the <code>rcsmerge</code> command on
the two versions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your
working directory, with the name <samp><span class="file">.#</span><var>file</var><span class="file">.</span><var>version</var></samp>,
where <var>version</var> is the RCS revision that your modified file started
from.  See <a href="Viewing-differences.html#Viewing-differences">Viewing differences</a>, for more details.

     <p>A conflict can also come from a disagreement on the existence of the file
rather than on its content.  This case is indicated by the following
possible substatus:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">removed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is locally removed but a new revision has been committed to
the repository by someone else.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">added</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is locally added and has also been added to the repository
by someone else.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">modified</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is locally modified but someone else has removed it from the
repository. 
</dl>

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Added</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file has been added by you, but it still needs to be checked in to
the repository.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Removed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file has been removed by you, but it still needs to be checked in to
the repository.  You can resurrect it by typing <kbd>a</kbd> (see <a href="Adding-and-removing-files.html#Adding-and-removing-files">Adding and removing files</a>).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Unknown</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A file that was detected in your directory, but that neither appears in
the repository, nor is present on the list of files that CVS should
ignore.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Up-to-date</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file is up to date with respect to the version in the repository. 
This status can have a substatus of:

          <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">added</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>You have just added the file to the repository.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">updated</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository.  This is
done for any file that exists in the repository but not in your source,
and for files that you haven't changed but are not the most recent
versions available in the repository.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">patched</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file was brought up to date with respect to the remote repository by
way of fetching and applying a patch to the file in your source.  This
is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">updated</span></samp>&rsquo; except that CVS decided to use a hopefully
more efficient method.

          <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">committed</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>You just committed the file. 
</dl>

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Need-Update</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Either a newer version than the one in your source is available in the
repository and you have not modified your checked out version, or the
file exists in the repository but not in your source.  Use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-mode-update</span></samp>&rsquo; bound to <kbd>O</kbd> to update the file.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Need-Merge</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>You have modified the checked out version of the file, and a newer
version is available in the repository.  A merge will take place when
you run a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs-update</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Missing</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file has been unexpectedly removed from your working directory
although it has not been &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cvs remove</span></samp>&rsquo;d. 
</dl>
