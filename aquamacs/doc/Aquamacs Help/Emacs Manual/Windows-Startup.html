<h3 class="section">G.1 How to Start Emacs on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-starting-Emacs-on-MS_002dWindows-4374"></a>
  There are several ways of starting Emacs on MS-Windows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><a name="index-runemacs_002eexe-4375"></a><a name="index-desktop-shortcut_002c-MS_002dWindows-4376"></a><a name="index-start-directory_002c-MS_002dWindows-4377"></a><a name="index-directory-where-Emacs-starts-on-MS_002dWindows-4378"></a>From the desktop shortcut icon: either double-click the left mouse
button on the icon, or click once, then press &lt;RET&gt;.  The desktop
shortcut should specify as its &ldquo;Target&rdquo; (in the &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; of
the shortcut) the full absolute file name of <samp><span class="file">runemacs.exe</span></samp>,
<em>not</em> of <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp>.  This is because <samp><span class="file">runemacs.exe</span></samp>
hides the console window that would have been created if the target of
the shortcut were <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp> (which is a console program, as far
as Windows is concerned).  If you use this method, Emacs starts in the
directory specified by the shortcut.  To control where that is,
right-click on the shortcut, select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;, and in the
&ldquo;Shortcut&rdquo; tab modify the &ldquo;Start in&rdquo; field to your liking.

     <li>From the Command Prompt window, by typing <kbd>emacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> at the
prompt.  The Command Prompt window where you did that will not be
available for invoking other commands until Emacs exits.  In this
case, Emacs will start in the current directory of the Windows shell.

     <li>From the Command Prompt window, by typing <kbd>runemacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> at
the prompt.  The Command Prompt window where you did that will be
immediately available for invoking other commands.  In this case,
Emacs will start in the current directory of the Windows shell.

     <li><a name="index-invoking-Emacs-from-Windows-Explorer-4379"></a><a name="index-emacsclient_002eexe-4380"></a><a name="index-emacsclientw_002eexe-4381"></a>Via the Emacs client program, <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp>.  This allows to invoke Emacs from other
programs, and to reuse a running Emacs process for serving editing
jobs required by other programs.  See <a href="Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.  The difference
between <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp> is that the
former waits for Emacs to signal that the editing job is finished,
while the latter does not wait.  Which one of them to use in each case
depends on the expectations of the program that needs editing
services.  If the program will use the edited files, it needs to wait
for Emacs, so you should use <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp>.  By contrast, if
the results of editing are not needed by the invoking program, you
will be better off using <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp>.  A notable situation
where you would want <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp> is when you right-click
on a file in the Windows Explorer and select &ldquo;Open With&rdquo; from the
pop-up menu.  Use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--alternate-editor=</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>&rsquo; options
if Emacs might not be running (or not running as a server) when
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> is invoked&mdash;that will always give you an
editor.  When invoked via <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>, Emacs will start in
the current directory of the program that invoked
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>.
