<h3 class="section">G.1 How to Start Emacs on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-starting-Emacs-on-MS_002dWindows-4711"></a>
  There are several ways of starting Emacs on MS-Windows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><a name="index-runemacs_002eexe-4712"></a><a name="index-desktop-shortcut_002c-MS_002dWindows-4713"></a><a name="index-start-directory_002c-MS_002dWindows-4714"></a><a name="index-directory-where-Emacs-starts-on-MS_002dWindows-4715"></a>From the desktop shortcut icon: either double-click the left mouse
button on the icon, or click once, then press &lt;RET&gt;.  The desktop
shortcut should specify as its &ldquo;Target&rdquo; (in the &ldquo;Properties&rdquo; of
the shortcut) the full absolute file name of <samp><span class="file">runemacs.exe</span></samp>,
<em>not</em> of <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp>.  This is because <samp><span class="file">runemacs.exe</span></samp>
hides the console window that would have been created if the target of
the shortcut were <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp> (which is a console program, as far
as Windows is concerned).  If you use this method, Emacs starts in the
directory specified by the shortcut.  To control where that is,
right-click on the shortcut, select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;, and in the
&ldquo;Shortcut&rdquo; tab modify the &ldquo;Start in&rdquo; field to your liking.

     <li>From the Command Prompt window, by typing <kbd>emacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> at the
prompt.  The Command Prompt window where you did that will not be
available for invoking other commands until Emacs exits.  In this
case, Emacs will start in the current directory of the Windows shell.

     <li>From the Command Prompt window, by typing <kbd>runemacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> at
the prompt.  The Command Prompt window where you did that will be
immediately available for invoking other commands.  In this case,
Emacs will start in the current directory of the Windows shell.

     <li><a name="index-invoking-Emacs-from-Windows-Explorer-4716"></a><a name="index-emacsclient_002eexe-4717"></a><a name="index-emacsclientw_002eexe-4718"></a>Via <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp>, which allow you
to invoke Emacs from other programs, and to reuse a running Emacs
process for serving editing jobs required by other programs. 
See <a href="Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.  The difference between <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp> is that the former is a console program,
while the latter is a Windows GUI program.  Both programs wait for
Emacs to signal that the editing job is finished, before they exit and
return control to the program that invoked them.  Which one of them to
use in each case depends on the expectations of the program that needs
editing services.  If that program is itself a console (text-mode)
program, you should use <samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp>, so that any of its
messages and prompts appear in the same command window as those of the
invoking program.  By contrast, if the invoking program is a GUI
program, you will be better off using <samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp>, because
<samp><span class="file">emacsclient.exe</span></samp> will pop up a command window if it is invoked
from a GUI program.  A notable situation where you would want
<samp><span class="file">emacsclientw.exe</span></samp> is when you right-click on a file in the
Windows Explorer and select &ldquo;Open With&rdquo; from the pop-up menu.  Use
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--alternate-editor=</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>&rsquo; options if Emacs might not
be running (or not running as a server) when <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> is
invoked&mdash;that will always give you an editor.  When invoked via
<samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>, Emacs will start in the current directory of
the program that invoked <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp>.
        </ol>

   <p><a name="index-emacsclient_002c-on-MS_002dWindows-4719"></a>Note that, due to limitations of MS-Windows, Emacs cannot have both
GUI and text-mode frames in the same session.  It also cannot open
text-mode frames on more than a single <dfn>Command Prompt</dfn> window,
because each Windows program can have only one console at any given
time.  For these reasons, if you invoke <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> with the
<samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option, and the Emacs server runs in a text-mode session,
Emacs will always create a new text-mode frame in the same
<dfn>Command Prompt</dfn> window where it was started; a GUI frame will be
created only if the server runs in a GUI session.  Similarly, if you
invoke <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> with the <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp> option, Emacs will
create a GUI frame if the server runs in a GUI session, or a text-mode
frame when the session runs in text mode in a <dfn>Command Prompt</dfn>
window.  See <a href="emacsclient-Options.html#emacsclient-Options">emacsclient Options</a>.
