<h3 class="section">30.16 Dired and <code>find</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfind_007d-and-Dired-3207"></a>
  You can select a set of files for display in a Dired buffer more
flexibly by using the <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> utility to choose the files.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dname_002ddired-3208"></a>  To search for files with names matching a wildcard pattern use
<kbd>M-x find-name-dired</kbd>.  It reads arguments <var>directory</var> and
<var>pattern</var>, and chooses all the files in <var>directory</var> or its
subdirectories whose individual names match <var>pattern</var>.

   <p>The files thus chosen are displayed in a Dired buffer, in which the
ordinary Dired commands are available.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dgrep_002ddired-3209"></a>  If you want to test the contents of files, rather than their names,
use <kbd>M-x find-grep-dired</kbd>.  This command reads two minibuffer
arguments, <var>directory</var> and <var>regexp</var>; it chooses all the files
in <var>directory</var> or its subdirectories that contain a match for
<var>regexp</var>.  It works by running the programs <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>.  See also <kbd>M-x grep-find</kbd>, in <a href="Grep-Searching.html#Grep-Searching">Grep Searching</a>.  Remember to write the regular expression for
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>, not for Emacs.  (An alternative method of showing
files whose contents match a given regexp is the <kbd>% g
</kbd><var>regexp</var> command, see <a href="Marks-vs-Flags.html#Marks-vs-Flags">Marks vs Flags</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-find_002ddired-3210"></a>  The most general command in this series is <kbd>M-x find-dired</kbd>,
which lets you specify any condition that <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> can test.  It
takes two minibuffer arguments, <var>directory</var> and <var>find-args</var>;
it runs <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> in <var>directory</var>, passing <var>find-args</var> to
tell <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> what condition to test.  To use this command, you
need to know how to use <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dls_002doption-3211"></a>  The format of listing produced by these commands is controlled by
the variable <code>find-ls-option</code>.  This is a pair of options; the
first specifying how to call <samp><span class="command">find</span></samp> to produce the file listing,
and the second telling Dired to parse the output.

   <p><a name="index-locate-3212"></a><a name="index-locate_002dwith_002dfilter-3213"></a><a name="index-file-database-_0028locate_0029-3214"></a><a name="index-locate_002dcommand-3215"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x locate</kbd> provides a similar interface to the
<samp><span class="command">locate</span></samp> program.  <kbd>M-x locate-with-filter</kbd> is similar, but
keeps only files whose names match a given regular expression.

   <p>These buffers don't work entirely like ordinary Dired buffers: file
operations work, but do not always automatically update the buffer. 
Reverting the buffer with <kbd>g</kbd> deletes all inserted subdirectories,
and erases all flags and marks.
