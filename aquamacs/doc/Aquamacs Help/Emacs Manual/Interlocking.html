<h4 class="subsection">18.3.4 Protection against Simultaneous Editing</h4>

<p><a name="index-file-dates-1072"></a><a name="index-simultaneous-editing-1073"></a>  Simultaneous editing occurs when two users visit the same file, both
make changes, and then both save them.  If nobody is informed that
this is happening, whichever user saves first would later find that
his changes were lost.

   <p>On some systems, Emacs notices immediately when the second user starts
to change the file, and issues an immediate warning.  On all systems,
Emacs checks when you save the file, and warns if you are about to
overwrite another user's changes.  You can prevent loss of the other
user's work by taking the proper corrective action instead of saving the
file.

   <p><a name="index-ask_002duser_002dabout_002dlock-1074"></a><a name="index-locking-files-1075"></a>  When you make the first modification in an Emacs buffer that is
visiting a file, Emacs records that the file is <dfn>locked</dfn> by you. 
(It does this by creating a specially-named symbolic link or regular
file with special contents in the same directory.)  Emacs removes the
lock when you save the changes.  The idea is that the file is locked
whenever an Emacs buffer visiting it has unsaved changes.

   <p><a name="index-create_002dlockfiles-1076"></a>  You can prevent the creation of lock files by setting the variable
<code>create-lockfiles</code> to <code>nil</code>.  <strong>Caution:</strong> by
doing so you will lose the benefits that this feature provides.

   <p><a name="index-collision-1077"></a>  If you begin to modify the buffer while the visited file is locked by
someone else, this constitutes a <dfn>collision</dfn>.  When Emacs detects a
collision, it asks you what to do, by calling the Lisp function
<code>ask-user-about-lock</code>.  You can redefine this function for the sake
of customization.  The standard definition of this function asks you a
question and accepts three possible answers:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>s</kbd><dd>Steal the lock.  Whoever was already changing the file loses the lock,
and you gain the lock. 
<br><dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Proceed.  Go ahead and edit the file despite its being locked by someone else. 
<br><dt><kbd>q</kbd><dd>Quit.  This causes an error (<code>file-locked</code>), and the buffer
contents remain unchanged&mdash;the modification you were trying to make
does not actually take place. 
</dl>

   <p>If Emacs or the operating system crashes, this may leave behind lock
files which are stale, so you may occasionally get warnings about
spurious collisions.  When you determine that the collision is
spurious, just use <kbd>p</kbd> to tell Emacs to go ahead anyway.

   <p>Note that locking works on the basis of a file name; if a file has
multiple names, Emacs does not prevent two users from editing it
simultaneously under different names.

   <p>A lock file cannot be written in some circumstances, e.g., if Emacs
lacks the system permissions or cannot create lock files for some
other reason.  In these cases, Emacs can still detect the collision
when you try to save a file, by checking the file's last-modification
date.  If the file has changed since the last time Emacs visited or
saved it, that implies that changes have been made in some other way,
and will be lost if Emacs proceeds with saving.  Emacs then displays a
warning message and asks for confirmation before saving; answer
<kbd>yes</kbd> to save, and <kbd>no</kbd> or <kbd>C-g</kbd> cancel the save.

   <p>If you are notified that simultaneous editing has already taken
place, one way to compare the buffer to its file is the <kbd>M-x
diff-buffer-with-file</kbd> command.  See <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>.
