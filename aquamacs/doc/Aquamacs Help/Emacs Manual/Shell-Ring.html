(<code>comint-dynamic-list-input-ring</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>Shell buffers provide a history of previously entered shell
commands.  To reuse shell commands from the history, use the editing
commands <kbd>M-p</kbd>, <kbd>M-n</kbd>, <kbd>M-r</kbd> and <kbd>M-s</kbd>.  These work
just like the minibuffer history commands (see <a href="Minibuffer-History.html#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>), except that they operate within the Shell buffer rather
than the minibuffer.

   <p><kbd>M-p</kbd> fetches an earlier shell command to the end of the shell
buffer.  Successive use of <kbd>M-p</kbd> fetches successively earlier
shell commands, each replacing any text that was already present as
potential shell input.  <kbd>M-n</kbd> does likewise except that it finds
successively more recent shell commands from the buffer. 
<kbd>C-&lt;UP&gt;</kbd> works like <kbd>M-p</kbd>, and <kbd>C-&lt;DOWN&gt;</kbd> like
<kbd>M-n</kbd>.

   <p>The history search command <kbd>M-r</kbd> begins an incremental regular
expression search of previous shell commands.  After typing <kbd>M-r</kbd>,
start typing the desired string or regular expression; the last
matching shell command will be displayed in the current line. 
Incremental search commands have their usual effects&mdash;for instance,
<kbd>C-s</kbd> and <kbd>C-r</kbd> search forward and backward for the next match
(see <a href="Incremental-Search.html#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>).  When you find the desired input, type
&lt;RET&gt; to terminate the search.  This puts the input in the command
line.  Any partial input you were composing before navigating the
history list is restored when you go to the beginning or end of the
history ring.

   <p>Often it is useful to reexecute several successive shell commands that
were previously executed in sequence.  To do this, first find and
reexecute the first command of the sequence.  Then type <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd>;
that will fetch the following command&mdash;the one that follows the command
you just repeated.  Then type &lt;RET&gt; to reexecute this command.  You
can reexecute several successive commands by typing <kbd>C-c C-x
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> over and over.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-c .</kbd> (<code>comint-input-previous-argument</code>)
copies an individual argument from a previous command, like <kbd>ESC
.</kbd> in Bash.  The simplest use copies the last argument from the
previous shell command.  With a prefix argument <var>n</var>, it copies the
<var>n</var>th argument instead.  Repeating <kbd>C-c .</kbd> copies from an
earlier shell command instead, always using the same value of <var>n</var>
(don't give a prefix argument when you repeat the <kbd>C-c .</kbd>
command).

   <p>These commands get the text of previous shell commands from a special
history list, not from the shell buffer itself.  Thus, editing the shell
buffer, or even killing large parts of it, does not affect the history
that these commands access.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dinput_002dring_002dfile_002dname-3993"></a>  Some shells store their command histories in files so that you can
refer to commands from previous shell sessions.  Emacs reads
the command history file for your chosen shell, to initialize its own
command history.  The file name is <samp><span class="file">~/.bash_history</span></samp> for bash,
<samp><span class="file">~/.sh_history</span></samp> for ksh, and <samp><span class="file">~/.history</span></samp> for other shells.
