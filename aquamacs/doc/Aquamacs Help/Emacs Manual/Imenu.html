<h4 class="subsection">26.2.3 Imenu</h4>

<p><a name="index-index-of-buffer-definitions-2256"></a><a name="index-buffer-definitions-index-2257"></a>
  The Imenu facility offers a way to find the major definitions in
a file by name.  It is also useful in text formatter major modes,
where it treats each chapter, section, etc., as a definition. 
(See <a href="Tags.html#Tags">Tags</a>, for a more powerful feature that handles multiple files
together.)

   <p><a name="index-imenu-2258"></a>  If you type <kbd>M-x imenu</kbd>, it reads the name of a definition using
the minibuffer, then moves point to that definition.  You can use
completion to specify the name; the command always displays the whole
list of valid names.

   <p><a name="index-imenu_002dadd_002dmenubar_002dindex-2259"></a>  Alternatively, you can bind the command <code>imenu</code> to a mouse
click.  Then it displays mouse menus for you to select a definition
name.  You can also add the buffer's index to the menu bar by calling
<code>imenu-add-menubar-index</code>.  If you want to have this menu bar
item available for all buffers in a certain major mode, you can do
this by adding <code>imenu-add-menubar-index</code> to its mode hook.  But
if you have done that, you will have to wait a little while each time
you visit a file in that mode, while Emacs finds all the definitions
in that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-imenu_002dauto_002drescan-2260"></a>  When you change the contents of a buffer, if you add or delete
definitions, you can update the buffer's index based on the
new contents by invoking the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Rescan*</span></samp>&rsquo; item in the menu. 
Rescanning happens automatically if you set <code>imenu-auto-rescan</code> to
a non-<code>nil</code> value.  There is no need to rescan because of small
changes in the text.

   <p><a name="index-imenu_002dsort_002dfunction-2261"></a>  You can customize the way the menus are sorted by setting the
variable <code>imenu-sort-function</code>.  By default, names are ordered as
they occur in the buffer; if you want alphabetic sorting, use the
symbol <code>imenu--sort-by-name</code> as the value.  You can also
define your own comparison function by writing Lisp code.

   <p>Imenu provides the information to guide Which Function mode
(see <a href="Which-Function.html#Which-Function">Which Function</a>). 
The Speedbar can also use it (see <a href="Speedbar.html#Speedbar">Speedbar</a>).
