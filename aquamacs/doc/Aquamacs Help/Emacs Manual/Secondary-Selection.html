<h4 class="subsection">12.3.3 Secondary Selection</h4>

<p><a name="index-secondary-selection-460"></a>
  In addition to the primary selection, the X Window System provides a
second similar facility known as the <dfn>secondary selection</dfn>. 
Nowadays, few X applications make use of the secondary selection, but
you can access it using the following Emacs commands:

     
<a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dsecondary-461"></a>
<a name="index-M_002dDrag_002dMouse_002d1-462"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>M-Drag-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Set the secondary selection, with one end at the place where you press
down the button, and the other end at the place where you release it
(<code>mouse-set-secondary</code>).  The selected text is highlighted, using
the <code>secondary-selection</code> face, as you drag.  The window scrolls
automatically if you drag the mouse off the top or bottom of the
window, just like <code>mouse-set-region</code> (see <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>).

     <p>This command does not alter the kill ring.

     <p><a name="index-mouse_002dstart_002dsecondary-463"></a><a name="index-M_002dMouse_002d1-464"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Set one endpoint for the <dfn>secondary selection</dfn>
(<code>mouse-start-secondary</code>).

     <p><a name="index-mouse_002dsecondary_002dsave_002dthen_002dkill-465"></a><a name="index-M_002dMouse_002d3-466"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-Mouse-3</kbd><dd>Set the secondary selection, with one end at the position clicked and
the other at the position specified with <kbd>M-Mouse-1</kbd>
(<code>mouse-secondary-save-then-kill</code>).  This also puts the selected
text in the kill ring.  A second <kbd>M-Mouse-3</kbd> at the same place
kills the secondary selection just made.

     <p><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dsecondary-467"></a><a name="index-M_002dMouse_002d2-468"></a><br><dt><kbd>M-Mouse-2</kbd><dd>Insert the secondary selection where you click, placing point at the
end of the yanked text (<code>mouse-yank-secondary</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>Double or triple clicking of <kbd>M-Mouse-1</kbd> operates on words and
lines, much like <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>.

   <p>If <code>mouse-yank-at-point</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, <kbd>M-Mouse-2</kbd> yanks
at point.  Then it does not matter precisely where you click, or even
which of the frame's windows you click on.  See <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>.
