<h3 class="section">17.4 Executing Macros with Variations</h3>

<p>In a keyboard macro, you can create an effect similar to that of
<code>query-replace</code>, in that the macro asks you each time around
whether to make a change.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x q</kbd><dd>When this point is reached during macro execution, ask for confirmation
(<code>kbd-macro-query</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-q-985"></a><a name="index-kbd_002dmacro_002dquery-986"></a>  While defining the macro, type <kbd>C-x q</kbd> at the point where you
want the query to occur.  During macro definition, the <kbd>C-x q</kbd>
does nothing, but when you run the macro later, <kbd>C-x q</kbd> asks you
interactively whether to continue.

   <p>The valid responses when <kbd>C-x q</kbd> asks are:

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;SPC&gt; (or <kbd>y</kbd>)<dd>Continue executing the keyboard macro.

     <br><dt>&lt;DEL&gt; (or <kbd>n</kbd>)<dd>Skip the remainder of this repetition of the macro, and start right
away with the next repetition.

     <br><dt>&lt;RET&gt; (or <kbd>q</kbd>)<dd>Skip the remainder of this repetition and cancel further repetitions.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-r</kbd><dd>Enter a recursive editing level, in which you can perform editing
which is not part of the macro.  When you exit the recursive edit
using <kbd>C-M-c</kbd>, you are asked again how to continue with the
keyboard macro.  If you type a &lt;SPC&gt; at this time, the rest of the
macro definition is executed.  It is up to you to leave point and the
text in a state such that the rest of the macro will do what you want. 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>C-u C-x q</kbd>, which is <kbd>C-x q</kbd> with a numeric argument,
performs a completely different function.  It enters a recursive edit
reading input from the keyboard, both when you type it during the
definition of the macro, and when it is executed from the macro.  During
definition, the editing you do inside the recursive edit does not become
part of the macro.  During macro execution, the recursive edit gives you
a chance to do some particularized editing on each repetition.
