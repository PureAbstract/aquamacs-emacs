  If you have a device connected to a serial port of your computer,
you can communicate with it by typing <kbd>M-x serial-term</kbd>.  This
command asks for a serial port name and speed, and switches to a new
Term mode buffer.  Emacs communicates with the serial device through
this buffer just like it does with a terminal in ordinary Term mode.

   <p>The speed of the serial port is measured in bits per second.  The
most common speed is 9600 bits per second.  You can change the speed
interactively by clicking on the mode line.

   <p>A serial port can be configured even more by clicking on &ldquo;8N1&rdquo; in
the mode line.  By default, a serial port is configured as &ldquo;8N1&rdquo;,
which means that each byte consists of 8 data bits, No parity check
bit, and 1 stopbit.

   <p>If the speed or the configuration is wrong, you cannot communicate
with your device and will probably only see garbage output in the
window.
