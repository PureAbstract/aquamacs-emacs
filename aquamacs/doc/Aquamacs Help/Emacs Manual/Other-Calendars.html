<h3 class="section">31.9 Conversion To and From Other Calendars</h3>

<p><a name="index-Gregorian-calendar-3334"></a>  The Emacs calendar displayed is <em>always</em> the Gregorian calendar,
sometimes called the &ldquo;new style&rdquo; calendar, which is used in most of
the world today.  However, this calendar did not exist before the
sixteenth century and was not widely used before the eighteenth century;
it did not fully displace the Julian calendar and gain universal
acceptance until the early twentieth century.  The Emacs calendar can
display any month since January, year 1 of the current era, but the
calendar displayed is always the Gregorian, even for a date at which
the Gregorian calendar did not exist.

   <p>While Emacs cannot display other calendars, it can convert dates to
and from several other calendars.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="Calendar-Systems.html#Calendar-Systems">Calendar Systems</a>:        The calendars Emacs understands
                             (aside from Gregorian). 
<li><a accesskey="2" href="To-Other-Calendar.html#To-Other-Calendar">To Other Calendar</a>:       Converting the selected date to various calendars. 
<li><a accesskey="3" href="From-Other-Calendar.html#From-Other-Calendar">From Other Calendar</a>:     Moving to a date specified in another calendar. 
</ul>
