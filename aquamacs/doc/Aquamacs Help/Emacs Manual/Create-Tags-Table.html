<h4 class="subsection">28.3.2 Creating Tags Tables</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007betags_007d-program-2883"></a>
  The <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> program is used to create a tags table file.  It knows
the syntax of several languages, as described in
<a href="Tag-Syntax.html#Tag-Syntax">Tag Syntax</a>. 
Here is how to run <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     etags <var>inputfiles</var>...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> program reads the specified files, and writes a tags
table named <samp><span class="file">TAGS</span></samp> in the current working directory.  You can
optionally specify a different file name for the tags table by using the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--output=</span><var>file</var></samp>&rsquo; option; specifying <samp><span class="file">-</span></samp> as a file name
prints the tags table to standard output.

   <p>If the specified files don't exist, <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> looks for
compressed versions of them and uncompresses them to read them.  Under
MS-DOS, <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> also looks for file names like <samp><span class="file">mycode.cgz</span></samp>
if it is given &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mycode.c</span></samp>&rsquo; on the command line and <samp><span class="file">mycode.c</span></samp>
does not exist.

   <p>If the tags table becomes outdated due to changes in the files
described in it, you can update it by running the <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>
program again.  If the tags table does not record a tag, or records it
for the wrong file, then Emacs will not be able to find that
definition until you update the tags table.  But if the position
recorded in the tags table becomes a little bit wrong (due to other
editing), Emacs will still be able to find the right position, with a
slight delay.

   <p>Thus, there is no need to update the tags table after each edit. 
You should update a tags table when you define new tags that you want
to have listed, or when you move tag definitions from one file to
another, or when changes become substantial.

   <p>You can make a tags table <dfn>include</dfn> another tags table, by
passing the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--include=</span><var>file</var></samp>&rsquo; option to <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>.  It
then covers all the files covered by the included tags file, as well
as its own.

   <p>If you specify the source files with relative file names when you run
<samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>, the tags file will contain file names relative to the
directory where the tags file was initially written.  This way, you can
move an entire directory tree containing both the tags file and the
source files, and the tags file will still refer correctly to the source
files.  If the tags file is <samp><span class="file">-</span></samp> or is in the <samp><span class="file">/dev</span></samp> directory,
however, the file names are
made relative to the current working directory.  This is useful, for
example, when writing the tags to <samp><span class="file">/dev/stdout</span></samp>.

   <p>When using a relative file name, it should not be a symbolic link
pointing to a tags file in a different directory, because this would
generally render the file names invalid.

   <p>If you specify absolute file names as arguments to <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>, then
the tags file will contain absolute file names.  This way, the tags file
will still refer to the same files even if you move it, as long as the
source files remain in the same place.  Absolute file names start with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;, or with &lsquo;<samp><var>device</var><span class="samp">:/</span></samp>&rsquo; on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

   <p>When you want to make a tags table from a great number of files,
you may have problems listing them on the command line, because some
systems have a limit on its length.  You can circumvent this limit by
telling <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> to read the file names from its standard
input, by typing a dash in place of the file names, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     find . -name "*.[chCH]" -print | etags -
</pre>
   <p><samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> recognizes the language used in an input file based
on its file name and contents.  You can specify the language
explicitly with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--language=</span><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo; option.  You can
intermix these options with file names; each one applies to the file
names that follow it.  Specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--language=auto</span></samp>&rsquo; to tell
<samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> to resume guessing the language from the file names
and file contents.  Specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--language=none</span></samp>&rsquo; to turn off
language-specific processing entirely; then <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> recognizes
tags by regexp matching alone (see <a href="Etags-Regexps.html#Etags-Regexps">Etags Regexps</a>).

   <p>The option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--parse-stdin=</span><var>file</var></samp>&rsquo; is mostly useful when
calling <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> from programs.  It can be used (only once) in
place of a file name on the command line.  <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> will read from
standard input and mark the produced tags as belonging to the file
<var>file</var>.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">etags --help</span></samp>&rsquo; outputs the list of the languages <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>
knows, and the file name rules for guessing the language.  It also prints
a list of all the available <samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp> options, together with a short
explanation.  If followed by one or more &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--language=</span><var>lang</var></samp>&rsquo;
options, it outputs detailed information about how tags are generated for
<var>lang</var>.
