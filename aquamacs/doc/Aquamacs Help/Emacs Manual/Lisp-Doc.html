<h4 class="subsection">30.6.3 Emacs Lisp Documentation Lookup</h4>

<p>As you edit Lisp code to be run in Emacs, you can use the commands
<kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>) and <kbd>C-h v</kbd>
(<code>describe-variable</code>) to view documentation of functions and
variables that you want to use.  These commands use the minibuffer to
read the name of a function or variable to document, and display the
documentation in a window.  Their default arguments are based on the
code in the neighborhood of point.  For <kbd>C-h f</kbd>, the default is
the function called in the innermost list containing point.  <kbd>C-h
v</kbd> uses the symbol name around or adjacent to point as its default.

   <p><a name="index-Eldoc-mode-2084"></a><a name="index-eldoc_002dmode-2085"></a>  A more automatic but less powerful method is Eldoc mode.  This minor
mode constantly displays in the echo area the argument list for the
function being called at point.  (In other words, it finds the
function call that point is contained in, and displays the argument
list of that function.)  If point is over a documented variable, it
shows the first line of the variable's docstring.  Eldoc mode applies
in Emacs Lisp and Lisp Interaction modes, and perhaps a few others
that provide special support for looking up doc strings.  Use the
command <kbd>M-x eldoc-mode</kbd> to enable or disable this feature.
