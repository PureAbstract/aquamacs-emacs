<h4 class="subsection">15.1.3 Errors in Incremental Search</h4>

<p>If your string is not found at all, the echo area says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Failing
I-Search</span></samp>&rsquo;, and the cursor moves past the place where Emacs found as
much of your string as it could.  Thus, if you search for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>&rsquo;,
and there is no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>&rsquo;, you might see the cursor after the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOL</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In the echo area, the part of the search
string that failed to match is highlighted using the face
<code>isearch-fail</code>.

   <p>At this point, there are several things you can do.  If your string
was mistyped, you can use &lt;DEL&gt; to erase some of it and correct
it.  If you like the place you have found, you can type &lt;RET&gt; to
remain there.  Or you can type <kbd>C-g</kbd>, which removes from the
search string the characters that could not be found (the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>&rsquo; in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>&rsquo;), leaving those that were found (the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOO</span></samp>&rsquo; in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOT</span></samp>&rsquo;).  A second <kbd>C-g</kbd> at that point cancels the search
entirely, returning point to where it was when the search started.

just what it does depends on the status of the search.  If the search
has found what you specified and is waiting for input, <kbd>C-g</kbd>
cancels the entire search, moving the cursor back to where you started
the search.  If <kbd>C-g</kbd> is typed when there are characters in the
search string that have not been found&mdash;because Emacs is still
searching for them, or because it has failed to find them&mdash;then the
search string characters which have not been found are discarded from
the search string.  With them gone, the search is now successful and
waiting for more input, so a second <kbd>C-g</kbd> will cancel the entire
search.
