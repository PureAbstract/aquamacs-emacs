<h3 class="section">22.9 Comparing Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-comparing-files-927"></a>
<a name="index-diff-928"></a><a name="index-diff_002dswitches-929"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x diff</kbd> prompts for two file names, using the
minibuffer, and displays the differences between the two files in a
buffer named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*diff*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This works by running the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>
program, using options taken from the variable <code>diff-switches</code>. 
The value of <code>diff-switches</code> should be a string; the default is
<code>"-c"</code> to specify a context diff.  See <a href="../diff/index.html#Top">Diff</a>, for more information about
<samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> output formats.

   <p>The output of the <code>diff</code> command is shown using a major mode
called Diff mode.  See <a href="Diff-Mode.html#Diff-Mode">Diff Mode</a>.

   <p><a name="index-diff_002dbackup-930"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x diff-backup</kbd> compares a specified file with its
most recent backup.  If you specify the name of a backup file,
<code>diff-backup</code> compares it with the source file that it is a
backup of.  In all other respects, this behaves like <kbd>M-x diff</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-diff_002dbuffer_002dwith_002dfile-931"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x diff-buffer-with-file</kbd> compares a specified
buffer with its corresponding file.  This shows you what changes you
would make to the file if you save the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-compare_002dwindows-932"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x compare-windows</kbd> compares the text in the
current window with that in the next window.  (For more information
about windows in Emacs, <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>.)  Comparison starts at point in
each window, after pushing each initial point value on the mark ring
in its respective buffer.  Then it moves point forward in each window,
one character at a time, until it reaches characters that don't match. 
Then the command exits.

   <p>If point in the two windows is followed by non-matching text when
the command starts, <kbd>M-x compare-windows</kbd> tries heuristically to
advance up to matching text in the two windows, and then exits.  So if
you use <kbd>M-x compare-windows</kbd> repeatedly, each time it either
skips one matching range or finds the start of another.

   <p><a name="index-compare_002dignore_002dcase-933"></a><a name="index-compare_002dignore_002dwhitespace-934"></a>  With a numeric argument, <code>compare-windows</code> ignores changes in
whitespace.  If the variable <code>compare-ignore-case</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, the comparison ignores differences in case as well. 
If the variable <code>compare-ignore-whitespace</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
<code>compare-windows</code> normally ignores changes in whitespace, and a
prefix argument turns that off.

   <p><a name="index-Smerge-mode-935"></a><a name="index-smerge_002dmode-936"></a><a name="index-failed-merges-937"></a><a name="index-merges_002c-failed-938"></a><a name="index-comparing-3-files-_0028_0040code_007bdiff3_007d_0029-939"></a>  You can use <kbd>M-x smerge-mode</kbd> to turn on Smerge mode, a minor
mode for editing output from the <samp><span class="command">diff3</span></samp> program.  This is
typically the result of a failed merge from a version control system
&ldquo;update&rdquo; outside VC, due to conflicting changes to a file.  Smerge
mode provides commands to resolve conflicts by selecting specific
changes.

   <p>See <a href="Emerge.html#Emerge">Emerge</a>,
for the Emerge facility, which provides a powerful interface for
merging files.
