<h3 class="section">15.6 Syntax of Regular Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-syntax-of-regexps-870"></a><a name="index-regular-expression-871"></a><a name="index-regexp-872"></a>
  This manual describes regular expression features that users
typically use.  See <a href="../elisp/Regular-Expressions.html#Regular-Expressions">Regular Expressions</a>, for additional features used mainly in Lisp
programs.

   <p>Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are
special constructs and the rest are <dfn>ordinary</dfn>.  An ordinary
character matches that same character and nothing else.  The special
characters are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$^.*+?[\</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; is special if
it ends a character alternative (see later).  The character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;
is special inside a character alternative.  Any other character
appearing in a regular expression is ordinary, unless a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;
precedes it.  (When you use regular expressions in a Lisp program,
each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; must be doubled, see the example near the end of this
section.)

   <p>For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and
therefore &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; is a regular expression that matches the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; and no other string.  (It does <em>not</em> match the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ff</span></samp>&rsquo;.)  Likewise, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo; is a regular expression that matches
only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (When case distinctions are being ignored, these regexps
also match &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">O</span></samp>&rsquo;, but we consider this a generalization
of &ldquo;the same string&rdquo;, rather than an exception.)

   <p>Any two regular expressions <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> can be concatenated. 
The result is a regular expression which matches a string if <var>a</var>
matches some amount of the beginning of that string and <var>b</var>
matches the rest of the string.  For example, concatenating the
regular expressions &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo; gives the regular expression
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>&rsquo;, which matches only the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Still trivial. 
To do something nontrivial, you need to use one of the special
characters.  Here is a list of them.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>.</kbd> <span class="roman">(Period)</span><dd>is a special character that matches any single character except a
newline.  For example, the regular expressions &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a.b</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any
three-character string that begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; and ends with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><kbd>*</kbd><dd>is not a construct by itself; it is a postfix operator that means to
match the preceding regular expression repetitively any number of
times, as many times as possible.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o*</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any number
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;s, including no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;s.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; always applies to the <em>smallest</em> possible preceding
expression.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fo*</span></samp>&rsquo; has a repeating &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo;, not a repeating
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>&rsquo;.  It matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fo</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on.

     <p>The matcher processes a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; construct by matching, immediately,
as many repetitions as can be found.  Then it continues with the rest
of the pattern.  If that fails, backtracking occurs, discarding some
of the matches of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;-modified construct in case that makes
it possible to match the rest of the pattern.  For example, in matching
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ca*ar</span></samp>&rsquo; against the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caaar</span></samp>&rsquo;, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a*</span></samp>&rsquo; first
tries to match all three &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;s; but the rest of the pattern is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ar</span></samp>&rsquo; and there is only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; left to match, so this try fails. 
The next alternative is for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a*</span></samp>&rsquo; to match only two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;s. 
With this choice, the rest of the regexp matches successfully.

     <br><dt><kbd>+</kbd><dd>is a postfix operator, similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; except that it must match
the preceding expression at least once.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ca+r</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the
strings &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caaaar</span></samp>&rsquo; but not the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>&rsquo;,
whereas &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ca*r</span></samp>&rsquo; matches all three strings.

     <br><dt><kbd>?</kbd><dd>is a postfix operator, similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; except that it can match
the preceding expression either once or not at all.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ca?r</span></samp>&rsquo;
matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>&rsquo;, and nothing else.

     <br><dt><kbd>*?</kbd>, <kbd>+?</kbd>, <kbd>??</kbd><dd><a name="index-non_002dgreedy-regexp-matching-873"></a>are non-<dfn>greedy</dfn> variants of the operators above.  The normal
operators &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; match as much as they can, as
long as the overall regexp can still match.  With a following
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, they will match as little as possible.

     <p>Thus, both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ab*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ab*?</span></samp>&rsquo; can match the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;
and the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abbbb</span></samp>&rsquo;; but if you try to match them both against
the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abbb</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ab*</span></samp>&rsquo; will match it all (the longest valid
match), while &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ab*?</span></samp>&rsquo;  will match just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; (the shortest
valid match).

     <p>Non-greedy operators match the shortest possible string starting at a
given starting point; in a forward search, though, the earliest
possible starting point for match is always the one chosen.  Thus, if
you search for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a.*?$</span></samp>&rsquo; against the text &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">abbab</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by
a newline, it matches the whole string.  Since it <em>can</em> match
starting at the first &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;, it does.

     <br><dt><kbd>\{</kbd><var>n</var><kbd>\}</kbd><dd>is a postfix operator specifying <var>n</var> repetitions&mdash;that is, the
preceding regular expression must match exactly <var>n</var> times in a
row.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x\{4\}</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xxxx</span></samp>&rsquo; and
nothing else.

     <br><dt><kbd>\{</kbd><var>n</var><kbd>,</kbd><var>m</var><kbd>\}</kbd><dd>is a postfix operator specifying between <var>n</var> and <var>m</var>
repetitions&mdash;that is, the preceding regular expression must match at
least <var>n</var> times, but no more than <var>m</var> times.  If <var>m</var> is
omitted, then there is no upper limit, but the preceding regular
expression must match at least <var>n</var> times.<br> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{0,1\}</span></samp>&rsquo; is
equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;. <br> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{0,\}</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;. <br> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\{1,\}</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><kbd>[ ... ]</kbd><dd>is a <dfn>character set</dfn>, beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo; and terminated by
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>In the simplest case, the characters between the two brackets are what
this set can match.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ad]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches either one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo; or
one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ad]*</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any string composed of just
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;s and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">d</span></samp>&rsquo;s (including the empty string).  It follows that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">c[ad]*r</span></samp>&rsquo; matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cr</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">car</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cdr</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">caddaar</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.

     <p>You can also include character ranges in a character set, by writing the
starting and ending characters with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; between them.  Thus,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a-z]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any lower-case <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter.  Ranges may be
intermixed freely with individual characters, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[a-z$%.]</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which matches any lower-case <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letter or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; or
period.

     <p>You can also include certain special <dfn>character classes</dfn> in a
character set.  A &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[:</span></samp>&rsquo; and balancing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:]</span></samp>&rsquo; enclose a
character class inside a character alternative.  For instance,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[[:alnum:]]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any letter or digit.  See <a href="../elisp/Char-Classes.html#Char-Classes">Char Classes</a>, for a list of character
classes.

     <p>To include a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; in a character set, you must make it the first
character.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]a]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To
include a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; as the first or last character of the
set, or put it after a range.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[]-]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>To include &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; in a set, put it anywhere but at the beginning of
the set.  (At the beginning, it complements the set&mdash;see below.)

     <p>When you use a range in case-insensitive search, you should write both
ends of the range in upper case, or both in lower case, or both should
be non-letters.  The behavior of a mixed-case range such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A-z</span></samp>&rsquo;
is somewhat ill-defined, and it may change in future Emacs versions.

     <br><dt><kbd>[^ ... ]</kbd><dd>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^</span></samp>&rsquo; begins a <dfn>complemented character set</dfn>, which matches any
character except the ones specified.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^a-z0-9A-Z]</span></samp>&rsquo; matches
all characters <em>except</em> <acronym>ASCII</acronym> letters and digits.

     <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is not special in a character set unless it is the first
character.  The character following the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is treated as if it
were first (in other words, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo; are not special there).

     <p>A complemented character set can match a newline, unless newline is
mentioned as one of the characters not to match.  This is in contrast to
the handling of regexps in programs such as <code>grep</code>.

     <br><dt><kbd>^</kbd><dd>is a special character that matches the empty string, but only at the
beginning of a line in the text being matched.  Otherwise it fails to
match anything.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^foo</span></samp>&rsquo; matches a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; that occurs at
the beginning of a line.

     <p>For historical compatibility reasons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used with this
meaning only at the beginning of the regular expression, or after
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\(</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><kbd>$</kbd><dd>is similar to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; but matches only at the end of a line.  Thus,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x+$</span></samp>&rsquo; matches a string of one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>&rsquo; or more at the end of a line.

     <p>For historical compatibility reasons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used with this
meaning only at the end of the regular expression, or before &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\)</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\|</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><kbd>\</kbd><dd>has two functions: it quotes the special characters (including
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;), and it introduces additional special constructs.

     <p>Because &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; quotes special characters, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\$</span></samp>&rsquo; is a regular
expression that matches only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\[</span></samp>&rsquo; is a regular
expression that matches only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on.

     <p>See the following section for the special constructs that begin
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</dl>

   <p>Note: for historical compatibility, special characters are treated as
ordinary ones if they are in contexts where their special meanings make no
sense.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*foo</span></samp>&rsquo; treats &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; as ordinary since there is
no preceding expression on which the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; can act.  It is poor practice
to depend on this behavior; it is better to quote the special character anyway,
regardless of where it appears.

   <p>As a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; is not special inside a character alternative, it can
never remove the special meaning of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  So you
should not quote these characters when they have no special meaning
either.  This would not clarify anything, since backslashes can
legitimately precede these characters where they <em>have</em> special
meaning, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[^\]</span></samp>&rsquo; (<code>"[^\\]"</code> for Lisp string syntax),
which matches any single character except a backslash.
