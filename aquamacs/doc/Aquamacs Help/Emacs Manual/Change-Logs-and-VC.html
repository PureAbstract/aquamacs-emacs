<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.12.1 Change Logs and VC</h5>

<p>If you use RCS or CVS for a program with a <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file
(see <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>),
you can generate change log entries from the version control log
entries of previous commits.

   <p>Note that this only works with RCS or CVS.  This procedure would be
particularly incorrect on a modern changeset-based version control
system, where changes to the <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file would normally be
committed as part of a changeset.  In that case, you should write the
change log entries first, then pull them into the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*vc-log*</span></samp>&rsquo;
buffer when you commit
(see <a href="Log-Buffer.html#Log-Buffer">Log Buffer</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v a</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002dx-v-a-2833"></a><a name="index-vc_002dupdate_002dchange_002dlog-2834"></a>Visit the current directory's <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file and, for
registered files in that directory, create new entries for versions
committed since the most recent change log entry
(<code>vc-update-change-log</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u C-x v a</kbd><dd>As above, but only find entries for the current buffer's file. 
</dl>

   <p>For example, suppose the first line of <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> is dated
1999-04-10, and that the only check-in since then was by Nathaniel
Bowditch to <samp><span class="file">rcs2log</span></samp> on 1999-05-22 with log entry &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Ignore
log messages that start with `#'.</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Then <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> inserts this
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry:

<pre class="smallexample">     1999-05-22  Nathaniel Bowditch  &lt;nat@apn.org&gt;
     
             * rcs2log: Ignore log messages that start with `#'.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the version control log entry specifies a function name (in
parenthesis at the beginning of a line), that is reflected in the
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry.  For example, if a log entry for <samp><span class="file">vc.el</span></samp>
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(vc-do-command): Check call-process status.</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> entry is:

<pre class="smallexample">     1999-05-06  Nathaniel Bowditch  &lt;nat@apn.org&gt;
     
             * vc.el (vc-do-command): Check call-process status.
</pre>
   <p>When <kbd>C-x v a</kbd> adds several change log entries at once, it
groups related log entries together if they all are checked in by the
same author at nearly the same time.  If the log entries for several
such files all have the same text, it coalesces them into a single
entry.
