<h3 class="section">27.1 How Major Modes are Chosen</h3>

<p><a name="index-choosing-a-major-mode-1503"></a>  You can select a major mode explicitly for the current buffer, but
most of the time Emacs determines which mode to use based on the file
name or on special text in the file.

   <p>To explicitly select a new major, you use an <kbd>M-x</kbd> command. 
Take the name of a major mode and add <code>-mode</code> to get the name of
the command to select that mode.  Thus, you can enter Lisp mode by
executing <kbd>M-x lisp-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dmode_002dalist-1504"></a>  When you visit a file, Emacs usually chooses the right major mode
automatically.  Normally, it makes the choice based on the file
name&mdash;for example, files whose names end in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; are normally
edited in C mode&mdash;but sometimes it chooses the major mode based on
the contents of the file.  Here is the exact procedure:

   <p>First, Emacs checks whether the file contains a file-local variable
that specifies the major mode.  If so, it uses that major mode,
ignoring all other criteria.  See <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.  There are
several methods to specify a major mode using a file-local variable;
the simplest is to put the mode name in the first nonblank line,
preceded and followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Other text may appear on the
line as well.  For example,

<pre class="example">     ; -*-Lisp-*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tells Emacs to use Lisp mode.  Note how the semicolon is used to make
Lisp treat this line as a comment.  Alternatively, you could write

<pre class="example">     ; -*- mode: Lisp;-*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The latter format allows you to specify local variables as well, like
this:

<pre class="example">     ; -*- mode: Lisp; tab-width: 4; -*-
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-interpreter_002dmode_002dalist-1505"></a>  Second, Emacs checks whether the file's contents begin with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If so, that indicates that the file can serve as an
executable shell command, which works by running an interpreter named
on the file's first line (the rest of the file is used as input to the
interpreter).  Therefore, Emacs tries to use the interpreter name to
choose a mode.  For instance, a file that begins with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!/usr/bin/perl</span></samp>&rsquo; is opened in Perl mode.  The variable
<code>interpreter-mode-alist</code> specifies the correspondence between
interpreter program names and major modes.

   <p>When the first line starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>&rsquo;, you usually cannot use
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo; feature on the first line, because the system would get
confused when running the interpreter.  So Emacs looks for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo;
on the second line in such files as well as on the first line.  The
same is true for man pages which start with the magic string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'\"</span></samp>&rsquo; to specify a list of troff preprocessors.

   <p><a name="index-magic_002dmode_002dalist-1506"></a>  Third, Emacs tries to determine the major mode by looking at the
text at the start of the buffer, based on the variable
<code>magic-mode-alist</code>.  By default, this variable is <code>nil</code> (an
empty list), so Emacs skips this step; however, you can customize it
in your init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  The value should be a list of
elements of the form

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>regexp</var> is a regular expression (see <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>), and
<var>mode-function</var> is a Lisp function that toggles a major mode.  If
the text at the beginning of the file matches <var>regexp</var>, Emacs
chooses the major mode specified by <var>mode-function</var>.

   <p>Alternatively, an element of <code>magic-mode-alist</code> may have the form

<pre class="example">     (<var>match-function</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>match-function</var> is a Lisp function that is called at the
beginning of the buffer; if the function returns non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs
set the major mode wit <var>mode-function</var>.

   <p>Fourth&mdash;if Emacs still hasn't found a suitable major mode&mdash;it
looks at the file's name.  The correspondence between file names and
major modes is controlled by the variable <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  Its
value is a list in which each element has this form,

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or this form,

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> <var>mode-function</var> <var>flag</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example, one element normally found in the list has the form
<code>(</code><tt>"\\.c\\'"</tt><code> . c-mode)</code>, and it is responsible for selecting C
mode for files whose names end in <samp><span class="file">.c</span></samp>.  (Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo; is
needed in Lisp syntax to include a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; in the string, which must
be used to suppress the special meaning of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; in regexps.)  If
the element has the form <code>(</code><var>regexp</var> <var>mode-function</var>
<var>flag</var><code>)</code> and <var>flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then after calling
<var>mode-function</var>, Emacs discards the suffix that matched
<var>regexp</var> and searches the list again for another match.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dmode_002dcase_002dfold-1507"></a>  On systems with case-insensitive file names, such as Microsoft
Windows, Emacs performs a single case-insensitive search through
<code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  On other systems, Emacs normally performs a
single case-sensitive search through the alist.  However, if you
change the variable <code>auto-mode-case-fold</code> to <code>t</code>, Emacs
performs a second case-insensitive search if the first search fails.

   <p><a name="index-magic_002dfallback_002dmode_002dalist-1508"></a>  Finally, if Emacs <em>still</em> hasn't found a major mode to use, it
compares the text at the start of the buffer to the variable
<code>magic-fallback-mode-alist</code>.  This variable works like
<code>magic-mode-alist</code>, described above, except that is consulted
only after <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  By default,
<code>magic-fallback-mode-alist</code> contains forms that check for image
files, HTML/XML/SGML files, and Postscript files.

   <p><a name="index-major_002dmode-1509"></a>  Once a major mode is chosen, Emacs sets the value of the variable
<code>major-mode</code> to the symbol for that major mode (e.g.,
<code>text-mode</code> for Text mode).  This is a per-buffer variable
(see <a href="Locals.html#Locals">Locals</a>); its buffer-local value is set automatically, and you
should not change it yourself.

   <p>The default value of <code>major-mode</code> determines the major mode to
use for files that do not specify a major mode, and for new buffers
created with <kbd>C-x b</kbd>.  Normally, this default value is the symbol
<code>fundamental-mode</code>, which specifies Fundamental mode.  You can
change it via the Customization interface (see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or by adding a line like this to your init file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq-default major-mode 'text-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the default value of <code>major-mode</code> is <code>nil</code>, the major
mode is taken from the previously current buffer.

   <p><a name="index-normal_002dmode-1510"></a>  If you have changed the major mode of a buffer, you can return to
the major mode Emacs would have chosen automatically, by typing
<kbd>M-x normal-mode</kbd>.  This is the same function that
<code>find-file</code> calls to choose the major mode.  It also processes
the file's &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo; line or local variables list (if any). 
See <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.

   <p><a name="index-change_002dmajor_002dmode_002dwith_002dfile_002dname-1511"></a>  The commands <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> and <code>set-visited-file-name</code> change to
a new major mode if the new file name implies a mode (see <a href="Saving.html#Saving">Saving</a>). 
(<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> does this too, if the buffer wasn't visiting a file.) 
However, this does not happen if the buffer contents specify a major
mode, and certain &ldquo;special&rdquo; major modes do not allow the mode to
change.  You can turn off this mode-changing feature by setting
<code>change-major-mode-with-file-name</code> to <code>nil</code>.
