<h3 class="section">23.3 Choosing File Modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-choosing-a-major-mode-1734"></a><a name="index-choosing-a-minor-mode-1735"></a><a name="index-auto_002dmode_002dalist-1736"></a>  When you visit a file, Emacs chooses a major mode automatically. 
Normally, it makes the choice based on the file name&mdash;for example,
files whose names end in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; are normally edited in C mode&mdash;but
sometimes it chooses the major mode based on special text in the file. 
This special text can also be used to enable buffer-local minor modes.

   <p>Here is the exact procedure:

   <p>First, Emacs checks whether the file contains file-local mode
variables.  See <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.  If there is a file-local variable
that specifies a major mode, then Emacs uses that major mode, ignoring
all other criteria.  There are several methods to specify a major mode
using a file-local variable; the simplest is to put the mode name in
the first nonblank line, preceded and followed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Other
text may appear on the line as well.  For example,

<pre class="example">     ; -*-Lisp-*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tells Emacs to use Lisp mode.  Note how the semicolon is used to make
Lisp treat this line as a comment.  You could equivalently write

<pre class="example">     ; -*- mode: Lisp;-*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can also use file-local variables to specify buffer-local minor
modes, by using <code>eval</code> specifications.  For example, this first
nonblank line puts the buffer in Lisp mode and enables Auto-Fill mode:

<pre class="example">     ; -*- mode: Lisp; eval: (auto-fill-mode 1); -*-
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note, however, that it is usually inappropriate to enable minor modes
this way, since most minor modes represent individual user
preferences.  If you personally want to use a minor mode for a
particular file type, it is better to enable the minor mode via a
major mode hook (see <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).

   <p><a name="index-interpreter_002dmode_002dalist-1737"></a>  Second, if there is no file variable specifying a major mode, Emacs
checks whether the file's contents begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If so, that
indicates that the file can serve as an executable shell command,
which works by running an interpreter named on the file's first line
(the rest of the file is used as input to the interpreter). 
Therefore, Emacs tries to use the interpreter name to choose a mode. 
For instance, a file that begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!/usr/bin/perl</span></samp>&rsquo; is opened
in Perl mode.  The variable <code>interpreter-mode-alist</code> specifies
the correspondence between interpreter program names and major modes.

   <p>When the first line starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>&rsquo;, you usually cannot use
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo; feature on the first line, because the system would get
confused when running the interpreter.  So Emacs looks for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo;
on the second line in such files as well as on the first line.  The
same is true for man pages which start with the magic string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'\"</span></samp>&rsquo; to specify a list of troff preprocessors.

   <p><a name="index-magic_002dmode_002dalist-1738"></a>  Third, Emacs tries to determine the major mode by looking at the
text at the start of the buffer, based on the variable
<code>magic-mode-alist</code>.  By default, this variable is <code>nil</code> (an
empty list), so Emacs skips this step; however, you can customize it
in your init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  The value should be a list of
elements of the form

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>regexp</var> is a regular expression (see <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>), and
<var>mode-function</var> is a major mode command.  If the text at the
beginning of the file matches <var>regexp</var>, Emacs chooses the major
mode specified by <var>mode-function</var>.

   <p>Alternatively, an element of <code>magic-mode-alist</code> may have the form

<pre class="example">     (<var>match-function</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>match-function</var> is a Lisp function that is called at the
beginning of the buffer; if the function returns non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs
set the major mode with <var>mode-function</var>.

   <p>Fourth&mdash;if Emacs still hasn't found a suitable major mode&mdash;it
looks at the file's name.  The correspondence between file names and
major modes is controlled by the variable <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  Its
value is a list in which each element has this form,

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> . <var>mode-function</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or this form,

<pre class="example">     (<var>regexp</var> <var>mode-function</var> <var>flag</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For example, one element normally found in the list has the form
<code>(</code><tt>"\\.c\\'"</tt><code> . c-mode)</code>, and it is responsible for selecting C
mode for files whose names end in <samp><span class="file">.c</span></samp>.  (Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\</span></samp>&rsquo; is
needed in Lisp syntax to include a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; in the string, which must
be used to suppress the special meaning of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; in regexps.)  If
the element has the form <code>(</code><var>regexp</var> <var>mode-function</var>
<var>flag</var><code>)</code> and <var>flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then after calling
<var>mode-function</var>, Emacs discards the suffix that matched
<var>regexp</var> and searches the list again for another match.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dmode_002dcase_002dfold-1739"></a>  On GNU/Linux and other systems with case-sensitive file names, Emacs
performs a case-sensitive search through <code>auto-mode-alist</code>; if
this search fails, it performs a second case-insensitive search
through the alist.  To suppress the second search, change the variable
<code>auto-mode-case-fold</code> to <code>nil</code>.  On systems with
case-insensitive file names, such as Microsoft Windows, Emacs performs
a single case-insensitive search through <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.

   <p><a name="index-magic_002dfallback_002dmode_002dalist-1740"></a>  Finally, if Emacs <em>still</em> hasn't found a major mode to use, it
compares the text at the start of the buffer to the variable
<code>magic-fallback-mode-alist</code>.  This variable works like
<code>magic-mode-alist</code>, described above, except that is consulted
only after <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.  By default,
<code>magic-fallback-mode-alist</code> contains forms that check for image
files, HTML/XML/SGML files, and PostScript files.

   <p><a name="index-normal_002dmode-1741"></a>  If you have changed the major mode of a buffer, you can return to
the major mode Emacs would have chosen automatically, by typing
<kbd>M-x normal-mode</kbd>.  This is the same function that
<code>find-file</code> calls to choose the major mode.  It also processes
the file's &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo; line or local variables list (if any). 
See <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>.

   <p><a name="index-change_002dmajor_002dmode_002dwith_002dfile_002dname-1742"></a>  The commands <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> and <code>set-visited-file-name</code> change to
a new major mode if the new file name implies a mode (see <a href="Saving.html#Saving">Saving</a>). 
(<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> does this too, if the buffer wasn't visiting a file.) 
However, this does not happen if the buffer contents specify a major
mode, and certain &ldquo;special&rdquo; major modes do not allow the mode to
change.  You can turn off this mode-changing feature by setting
<code>change-major-mode-with-file-name</code> to <code>nil</code>.
