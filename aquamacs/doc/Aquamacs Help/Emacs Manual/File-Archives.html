<h3 class="section">18.13 File Archives</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode_002c-tar-1199"></a><a name="index-Tar-mode-1200"></a><a name="index-file-archives-1201"></a>
  A file whose name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.tar</span></samp>&rsquo; is normally an <dfn>archive</dfn>
made by the <code>tar</code> program.  Emacs views these files in a special
mode called Tar mode which provides a Dired-like list of the contents
(see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).  You can move around through the list just as you
would in Dired, and visit the subfiles contained in the archive. 
However, not all Dired commands are available in Tar mode.

   <p>If Auto Compression mode is enabled (see <a href="Compressed-Files.html#Compressed-Files">Compressed Files</a>), then
Tar mode is used also for compressed archives&mdash;files with extensions
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.tgz</span></samp>&rsquo;, <code>.tar.Z</code> and <code>.tar.gz</code>.

   <p>The keys <kbd>e</kbd>, <kbd>f</kbd> and &lt;RET&gt; all extract a component file
into its own buffer.  You can edit it there, and if you save the
buffer, the edited version will replace the version in the Tar buffer. 
Clicking with the mouse on the file name in the Tar buffer does
likewise.  <kbd>v</kbd> extracts a file into a buffer in View mode
(see <a href="View-Mode.html#View-Mode">View Mode</a>).  <kbd>o</kbd> extracts the file and displays it in
another window, so you could edit the file and operate on the archive
simultaneously.

   <p><kbd>d</kbd> marks a file for deletion when you later use <kbd>x</kbd>, and
<kbd>u</kbd> unmarks a file, as in Dired.  <kbd>C</kbd> copies a file from the
archive to disk and <kbd>R</kbd> renames a file within the archive. 
<kbd>g</kbd> reverts the buffer from the archive on disk.  The keys
<kbd>M</kbd>, <kbd>G</kbd>, and <kbd>O</kbd> change the file's permission bits,
group, and owner, respectively.

   <p>Saving the Tar buffer writes a new version of the archive to disk with
the changes you made to the components.

   <p>You don't need the <code>tar</code> program to use Tar mode&mdash;Emacs reads
the archives directly.  However, accessing compressed archives
requires the appropriate uncompression program.

<code>jar</code>, <code>lzh</code>, <code>zip</code>, <code>rar</code>, <code>7z</code>, and
<code>zoo</code> archives, as well as <code>exe</code> files that are
self-extracting executables.

   <p>The key bindings of Archive mode are similar to those in Tar mode,
with the addition of the <kbd>m</kbd> key which marks a file for subsequent
operations, and <kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> which unmarks all the marked files. 
Also, the <kbd>a</kbd> key toggles the display of detailed file
information, for those archive types where it won't fit in a single
line.  Operations such as renaming a subfile, or changing its mode or
owner, are supported only for some of the archive formats.

   <p>Unlike Tar mode, Archive mode runs the archiving programs to unpack
and repack archives.  However, you don't need these programs to look
at the archive table of contents, only to extract or manipulate the
subfiles in the archive.  Details of the program names and their
options can be set in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Archive</span></samp>&rsquo; Customize group.
