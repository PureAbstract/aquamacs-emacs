<h4 class="subsection">48.1.3 Changing a Variable</h4>

<p>Here is an example of what a variable, or user option, looks like in
the customization buffer:

<pre class="smallexample">     [Hide] Kill Ring Max: 60
        [State]: STANDARD.
        Maximum length of kill ring before oldest elements are thrown away.
</pre>
   <p>The first line shows that the variable is named
<code>kill-ring-max</code>, formatted as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Kill Ring Max</span></samp>&rsquo; for easier
viewing.  Its value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">60</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The button labeled &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Hide]</span></samp>&rsquo;,
if activated, hides the variable's value and state; this is useful to
avoid cluttering up the customization buffer with very long values
(for this reason, variables that have very long values may start out
hidden).  If you use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Hide]</span></samp>&rsquo; button, it changes to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Show Value]</span></samp>&rsquo;, which you can activate to reveal the value and
state.  On a graphical display, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Hide]</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Show
Value]</span></samp>&rsquo; buttons are replaced with graphical triangles pointing
downwards and rightwards respectively.

   <p>The line after the variable name indicates the <dfn>customization
state</dfn> of the variable: in this example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">STANDARD</span></samp>&rsquo; means you
have not changed the variable, so its value is the default one.  The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>&rsquo; button gives a menu of operations for customizing the
variable.

   <p>Below the customization state is the documentation for the variable. 
This is the same documentation that would be shown by the <kbd>C-h v</kbd>
command (see <a href="Examining.html#Examining">Examining</a>).  If the documentation is more than one
line long, only one line may be shown.  If so, that line ends with a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[More]</span></samp>&rsquo; button; activate this to see the full documentation.

   <p><a name="index-user-options_002c-changing-4320"></a><a name="index-customizing-variables-4321"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-changing-4322"></a>  To enter a new value for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Kill Ring Max</span></samp>&rsquo;, just move point to
the value and edit it.  For example, type <kbd>M-d</kbd> to delete the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">60</span></samp>&rsquo; and type in another number.  As you begin to alter the text,
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>&rsquo; line will change:

<pre class="smallexample">     [State]: EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you
              set or save it.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Editing the value does not make it take effect right away.  To do
that, you must <dfn>set</dfn> the variable by activating the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>&rsquo;
button and choosing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Set for Current Session</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Then the
variable's state becomes:

<pre class="smallexample">     [State]: SET for current session only.
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You don't have to worry about specifying a value that is not valid;
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Set for Current Session</span></samp>&rsquo; operation checks for validity and
will not install an unacceptable value.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dTAB-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4323"></a><a name="index-C_002dM_002di-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4324"></a><a name="index-widget_002dcomplete-4325"></a>  While editing certain kinds of values, such as file names, directory
names, and Emacs command names, you can perform completion with
<kbd>C-M-i</kbd> (<code>widget-complete</code>), or the equivalent keys
<kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd>.  This behaves much
like minibuffer completion (see <a href="Completion.html#Completion">Completion</a>).

   <p>Typing &lt;RET&gt; on an editable value field moves point forward to
the next field or button, like &lt;TAB&gt;.  You can thus type &lt;RET&gt;
when you are finished editing a field, to move on to the next button
or field.  To insert a newline within an editable field, use <kbd>C-o</kbd>
or <kbd>C-q C-j</kbd>.

   <p>For some variables, there is only a fixed set of legitimate values,
and you are not allowed to edit the value directly.  Instead, a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Value Menu]</span></samp>&rsquo; button appears before the value; activating this
button presents a choice of values.  For a boolean &ldquo;on or off&rdquo;
value, the button says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Toggle]</span></samp>&rsquo;, and flips the value.  After
using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Value Menu]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Toggle]</span></samp>&rsquo; button, you must
again set the variable to make the chosen value take effect.

   <p>Some variables have values with complex structure.  For example, the
value of <code>minibuffer-frame-alist</code> is an association list.  Here
is how it appears in the customization buffer:

<pre class="smallexample">     [Hide] Minibuffer Frame Alist:
     [INS] [DEL] Parameter: width
                 Value: 80
     [INS] [DEL] Parameter: height
                 Value: 2
     [INS]
        [ State ]: STANDARD.
        Alist of parameters for the initial minibuffer frame. [Hide]
        <span class="roman">[...more lines of documentation...]</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this case, each association in the list consists of two items, one
labeled &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Parameter</span></samp>&rsquo; and one labeled &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Value</span></samp>&rsquo;; both are
editable fields.  You can delete an association from the list with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[DEL]</span></samp>&rsquo; button next to it.  To add an association, use the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[INS]</span></samp>&rsquo; button at the position where you want to insert it; the
very last &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[INS]</span></samp>&rsquo; button inserts at the end of the list.

   <p><a name="index-saving-a-setting-4326"></a><a name="index-settings_002c-how-to-save-4327"></a>  When you set a variable, the new value takes effect only in the
current Emacs session.  To <dfn>save</dfn> the value for future sessions,
use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and select the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Save for Future
Sessions</span></samp>&rsquo; operation.  See <a href="Saving-Customizations.html#Saving-Customizations">Saving Customizations</a>.

   <p>You can also restore the variable to its standard value by using the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>&rsquo; button and selecting the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Erase Customization</span></samp>&rsquo;
operation.  There are actually four reset operations:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Undo Edits</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>If you have modified but not yet set the variable, this restores the
text in the customization buffer to match the actual value.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Reset to Saved</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This restores the value of the variable to the last saved value,
and updates the text accordingly.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Erase Customization</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This sets the variable to its standard value.  Any saved value that
you have is also eliminated.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Set to Backup Value</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>This sets the variable to a previous value that was set in the
customization buffer in this session.  If you customize a variable
and then reset it, which discards the customized value,
you can get the discarded value back again with this operation. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-comments-on-customized-settings-4328"></a>  Sometimes it is useful to record a comment about a specific
customization.  Use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Add Comment</span></samp>&rsquo; item from the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>&rsquo; menu to create a field for entering the comment.

   <p>Near the top of the customization buffer are two lines of buttons:

<pre class="smallexample">      [Set for Current Session] [Save for Future Sessions]
      [Undo Edits] [Reset to Saved] [Erase Customization]   [Exit]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Each of the first five buttons performs the stated operation&mdash;set,
save, reset, etc.&mdash;on all the settings in the buffer that could
meaningfully be affected.  They do not operate on settings that are
hidden, nor on subgroups that are hidden or not visible in the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dc-C_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4329"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dc-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4330"></a><a name="index-Custom_002dset-4331"></a><a name="index-Custom_002dsave-4332"></a>  The command <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> (<code>Custom-set</code>) is equivalent to using
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Set for Current Session]</span></samp>&rsquo; button.  The command <kbd>C-x
C-s</kbd> (<code>Custom-save</code>) is like using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Save for Future
Sessions]</span></samp>&rsquo; button.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dbuffer_002ddone_002dkill-4333"></a>  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Exit]</span></samp>&rsquo; button switches out of the customization buffer,
and buries the buffer at the bottom of the buffer list.  To make it
kill the customization buffer instead, change the variable
<code>custom-buffer-done-kill</code> to <code>t</code>.
