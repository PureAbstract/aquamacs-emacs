<h3 class="section">18.7 File Name Aliases</h3>

<p><a name="index-symbolic-links-_0028visiting_0029-1113"></a><a name="index-hard-links-_0028visiting_0029-1114"></a>
  Symbolic links and hard links both make it possible for several file
names to refer to the same file.  Hard links are alternate names that
refer directly to the file; all the names are equally valid, and no one
of them is preferred.  By contrast, a symbolic link is a kind of defined
alias: when <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is a symbolic link to <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp>, you can use
either name to refer to the file, but <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp> is the real name, while
<samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is just an alias.  More complex cases occur when symbolic
links point to directories.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dexisting_002dother_002dname-1115"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dsuppress_002dsame_002dfile_002dwarnings-1116"></a>  Normally, if you visit a file which Emacs is already visiting under
a different name, Emacs displays a message in the echo area and uses
the existing buffer visiting that file.  This can happen on systems
that support hard or symbolic links, or if you use a long file name on
a system that truncates long file names, or on a case-insensitive file
system.  You can suppress the message by setting the variable
<code>find-file-suppress-same-file-warnings</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value.  You can disable this feature entirely by setting the variable
<code>find-file-existing-other-name</code> to <code>nil</code>: then if you visit
the same file under two different names, you get a separate buffer for
each file name.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dvisit_002dtruename-1117"></a><a name="index-truenames-of-files-1118"></a><a name="index-file-truenames-1119"></a>  If the variable <code>find-file-visit-truename</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
then the file name recorded for a buffer is the file's <dfn>truename</dfn>
(made by replacing all symbolic links with their target names), rather
than the name you specify.  Setting <code>find-file-visit-truename</code> also
implies the effect of <code>find-file-existing-other-name</code>.

   <p><a name="index-directory-name-abbreviation-1120"></a><a name="index-directory_002dabbrev_002dalist-1121"></a>  Sometimes, a directory is ordinarily accessed through a symbolic
link, and you may want Emacs to preferentially show its &ldquo;linked&rdquo;
name.  To do this, customize <code>directory-abbrev-alist</code>.  Each
element in this list should have the form <code>(</code><var>from</var><code>
. </code><var>to</var><code>)</code>, which means to replace <var>from</var> with <var>to</var> whenever
<var>from</var> appears in a directory name.  The <var>from</var> string is a
regular expression (see <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  It is matched against directory
names anchored at the first character, and should start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\`</span></samp>&rsquo;
(to support directory names with embedded newlines, which would defeat
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;).  The <var>to</var> string should be an ordinary absolute
directory name pointing to the same directory.  Do not use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; to
stand for a home directory in the <var>to</var> string; Emacs performs
these substitutions separately.  Here's an example, from a system on
which <samp><span class="file">/home/fsf</span></samp> is normally accessed through a symbolic link
named <samp><span class="file">/fsf</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     (("\\`/home/fsf" . "/fsf"))
</pre>
