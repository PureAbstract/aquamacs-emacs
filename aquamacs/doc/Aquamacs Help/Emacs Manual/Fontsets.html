<h3 class="section">22.13 Fontsets</h3>

<p><a name="index-fontsets-1673"></a>
  A font typically defines shapes for a single alphabet or script. 
Therefore, displaying the entire range of scripts that Emacs supports
requires a collection of many fonts.  In Emacs, such a collection is
called a <dfn>fontset</dfn>.  A fontset is defined by a list of font specifications,
each assigned to handle a range of character codes, and may fall back
on another fontset for characters that are not covered by the fonts
it specifies.

   <p><a name="index-fonts-for-various-scripts-1674"></a><a name="index-Intlfonts-package_002c-installation-1675"></a>  Each fontset has a name, like a font.  However, while fonts are
stored in the system and the available font names are defined by the
system, fontsets are defined within Emacs itself.  Once you have
defined a fontset, you can use it within Emacs by specifying its name,
anywhere that you could use a single font.  Of course, Emacs fontsets
can use only the fonts that the system supports.  If some characters
appear on the screen as empty boxes or hex codes, this means that the
fontset in use for them has no font for those characters.  In this
case, or if the characters are shown, but not as well as you would
like, you may need to install extra fonts.  Your operating system may
have optional fonts that you can install; or you can install the GNU
Intlfonts package, which includes fonts for most supported
scripts.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>Emacs creates three fontsets automatically: the <dfn>standard
fontset</dfn>, the <dfn>startup fontset</dfn> and the <dfn>default fontset</dfn>. 
<!-- FIXME?  The doc of *standard*-fontset-spec says: -->
<!-- "You have the biggest chance to display international characters -->
<!-- with correct glyphs by using the *standard* fontset." (my emphasis) -->
<!-- See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-04/msg00430.html -->
The default fontset is most likely to have fonts for a wide variety of
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters, and is the default fallback for the
other two fontsets, and if you set a default font rather than fontset. 
However, it does not specify font family names, so results can be
somewhat random if you use it directly.  You can specify use of a
particular fontset by starting Emacs with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fn</span></samp>&rsquo; option. 
For example,

<pre class="example">     emacs -fn fontset-standard
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You can also specify a fontset with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Font</span></samp>&rsquo; resource (see <a href="X-Resources.html#X-Resources">X Resources</a>).

   <p>If no fontset is specified for use, then Emacs uses an
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> font, with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fontset-default</span></samp>&rsquo; as a fallback for
characters the font does not cover.  The standard fontset is only used if
explicitly requested, despite its name.

   <p>A fontset does not necessarily specify a font for every character
code.  If a fontset specifies no font for a certain character, or if
it specifies a font that does not exist on your system, then it cannot
display that character properly.  It will display that character as a
hex code or thin space or an empty box instead.  (See <a href="Text-Display.html#Text-Display">glyphless characters</a>, for details.)

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> If you run Emacs on X, you may need to inform the X
server about the location of the newly installed fonts with commands
such as:
<!-- FIXME?  I feel like this may be out of date. -->
<!-- E.g., the intlfonts tarfile is ~ 10 years old. -->

<pre class="example">      xset fp+ /usr/local/share/emacs/fonts
      xset fp rehash
</pre>
