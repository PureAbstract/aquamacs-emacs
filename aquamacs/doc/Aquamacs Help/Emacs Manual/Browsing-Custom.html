<h4 class="subsection">48.1.2 Browsing and Searching for Settings</h4>

<p><a name="index-customize_002dbrowse-4318"></a>
  From the top-level customization buffer created by <kbd>M-x
customize</kbd>, you can follow the links to the subgroups of the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>&rsquo; customization group.  These subgroups may contain
settings for you to customize; they may also contain further subgroups,
dealing with yet more specialized subsystems of Emacs.  As you
navigate the hierarchy of customization groups, you should find some
settings that you want to customize.

   <p>If you are interested in customizing a particular setting or
customization group, you can go straight there with the commands
<kbd>M-x customize-option</kbd>, <kbd>M-x customize-face</kbd>, or <kbd>M-x
customize-group</kbd>.  See <a href="Specific-Customization.html#Specific-Customization">Specific Customization</a>.

   <p><a name="index-custom_002dsearch_002dfield-4319"></a>  If you don't know exactly what groups or settings you want to
customize, you can search for them using the editable search field at
the top of each customization buffer.  Here, you can type in a search
term&mdash;either one or more words separated by spaces, or a regular
expression (see <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  Then type &lt;RET&gt; in the field, or
activate the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Search</span></samp>&rsquo; button next to it, to switch to a
customization buffer containing groups and settings that match those
terms.  Note, however, that this feature only finds groups and
settings that are loaded in the current Emacs session.

   <p>If you don't want customization buffers to show the search field,
change the variable <code>custom-search-field</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x customize-apropos</kbd> is similar to using the
search field, except that it reads the search term(s) using the
minibuffer.  See <a href="Specific-Customization.html#Specific-Customization">Specific Customization</a>.

   <p><kbd>M-x customize-browse</kbd> is another way to browse the available
settings.  This command creates a special customization buffer which
shows only the names of groups and settings, in a structured layout. 
You can show the contents of a group, in the same buffer, by invoking
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[+]</span></samp>&rsquo; button next to the group name.  When the group contents
are shown, the button changes to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[-]</span></samp>&rsquo;; invoking that hides the
group contents again.  Each group or setting in this buffer has a link
which says &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Group]</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Option]</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Face]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Invoking
this link creates an ordinary customization buffer showing just that
group, option, or face; this is the way to change settings that you
find with <kbd>M-x customize-browse</kbd>.
