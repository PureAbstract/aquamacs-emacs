<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.1.4 Merge-based vs lock-based Version Control</h5>

<p><a name="index-locking-versus-merging-2474"></a>
  A version control system typically has some mechanism to coordinate
between users who want to change the same file.  There are two ways to
do this: merging and locking.

   <p>In a version control system that uses merging, each user may check
out and modify a work file at any time.  The system lets you
<dfn>merge</dfn> your work file, which may contain changes that have not
been committed, with the latest changes that others have committed.

   <p>Older version control systems use a <dfn>locking</dfn> scheme instead. 
Here, work files are normally read-only.  To edit a file, you ask the
version control system to make it writable for you by <dfn>locking</dfn>
it; only one user can lock a given file at any given time.  This
procedure is analogous to, but different from, the locking that Emacs
uses to detect simultaneous editing of ordinary files
(see <a href="Interlocking.html#Interlocking">Interlocking</a>).  When you commit your changes, that unlocks
the file, and the work file becomes read-only again.  Other users may
then lock the file to make their own changes.

   <p>Both locking and merging systems can have problems when multiple
users try to modify the same file at the same time.  Locking systems
have <dfn>lock conflicts</dfn>; a user may try to check a file out and be
unable to because it is locked.  In merging systems, <dfn>merge
conflicts</dfn> happen when you commit a change to a file that conflicts
with a change committed by someone else after your checkout.  Both
kinds of conflict have to be resolved by human judgment and
communication.  Experience has shown that merging is superior to
locking, both in convenience to developers and in minimizing the
number and severity of conflicts that actually occur.

   <p>SCCS always uses locking.  RCS is lock-based by default but can be
told to operate in a merging style.  CVS and Subversion are
merge-based by default but can be told to operate in a locking mode. 
Distributed version control systems, such as GNU Arch, git, and
Mercurial, are exclusively merging-based.

   <p>VC mode supports both locking and merging version control.  The
terms &ldquo;commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo; are used in newer version control
systems; older lock-based systems use the terms &ldquo;check in&rdquo; and
&ldquo;check out&rdquo;.  VC hides the differences between them as much as
possible.
