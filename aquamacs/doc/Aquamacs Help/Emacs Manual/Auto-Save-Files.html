<h4 class="subsection">18.6.1 Auto-Save Files</h4>

<p>Auto-saving does not normally save in the files that you visited,
because it can be very undesirable to save a change that you did not
want to make permanent.  Instead, auto-saving is done in a different
file called the <dfn>auto-save file</dfn>, and the visited file is changed
only when you request saving explicitly (such as with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>).

   <p>Normally, the auto-save file name is made by appending &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; to the
front and rear of the visited file name.  Thus, a buffer visiting file
<samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> is auto-saved in a file <samp><span class="file">#foo.c#</span></samp>.  Most buffers that
are not visiting files are auto-saved only if you request it explicitly;
when they are auto-saved, the auto-save file name is made by appending
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; to the front and rear of buffer name, then
adding digits and letters at the end for uniqueness.  For
example, the <samp><span class="file">*mail*</span></samp> buffer in which you compose messages to be
sent might be auto-saved in a file named <samp><span class="file">#*mail*#704juu</span></samp>.  Auto-save file
names are made this way unless you reprogram parts of Emacs to do
something different (the functions <code>make-auto-save-file-name</code> and
<code>auto-save-file-name-p</code>).  The file name to be used for auto-saving
in a buffer is calculated when auto-saving is turned on in that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave-for-remote-files-1101"></a><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dfile_002dname_002dtransforms-1102"></a>  The variable <code>auto-save-file-name-transforms</code> allows a degree
of control over the auto-save file name.  It lets you specify a series
of regular expressions and replacements to transform the auto save
file name.  The default value puts the auto-save files for remote
files (see <a href="Remote-Files.html#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>) into the temporary file directory on the
local machine.

   <p>When you delete a substantial part of the text in a large buffer, auto
save turns off temporarily in that buffer.  This is because if you
deleted the text unintentionally, you might find the auto-save file more
useful if it contains the deleted text.  To reenable auto-saving after
this happens, save the buffer with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>, or use <kbd>C-u 1 M-x
auto-save-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002dsave_002dvisited_002dfile_002dname-1103"></a>  If you want auto-saving to be done in the visited file rather than
in a separate auto-save file, set the variable
<code>auto-save-visited-file-name</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value.  In this
mode, there is no real difference between auto-saving and explicit
saving.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dauto_002dsave_002dfiles-1104"></a>  A buffer's auto-save file is deleted when you save the buffer in its
visited file.  (You can inhibit this by setting the variable
<code>delete-auto-save-files</code> to <code>nil</code>.)  Changing the visited
file name with <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> or <code>set-visited-file-name</code> renames
any auto-save file to go with the new visited name.
