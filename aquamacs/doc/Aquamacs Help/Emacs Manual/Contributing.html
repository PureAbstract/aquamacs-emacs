If you would like to help pretest Emacs releases to assure they work
well, or if you would like to work on improving Emacs, please contact
the maintainers at <a href="mailto:emacs-devel@gnu.org">emacs-devel@gnu.org</a>.  A pretester
should be prepared to investigate bugs as well as report them.  If you'd
like to work on improving Emacs, please ask for suggested projects or
suggest your own ideas.

   <p>If you have already written an improvement, please tell us about it.  If
you have not yet started work, it is useful to contact
<a href="mailto:emacs-devel@gnu.org">emacs-devel@gnu.org</a> before you start; it might be
possible to suggest ways to make your extension fit in better with the
rest of Emacs.

   <p>The development version of Emacs can be downloaded from the
repository where it is actively maintained by a group of developers. 
See the Emacs project page
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/">http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/</a> for details.

   <p>For more information on how to contribute, see the <samp><span class="file">etc/CONTRIBUTE</span></samp>
file in the Emacs distribution.
