<h3 class="section">40.1 Gnus Buffers</h3>

<p>Unlike most Emacs packages, Gnus uses several buffers to display
information and to receive commands.  The three Gnus buffers users use
most are the <dfn>group buffer</dfn>, the <dfn>summary buffer</dfn> and the
<dfn>article buffer</dfn>.

   <p>The <dfn>group buffer</dfn> contains a list of newsgroups.  This is the
first buffer Gnus displays when it starts up.  It normally displays
only the groups to which you subscribe and that contain unread
articles.  Use this buffer to select a specific group.

   <p>The <dfn>summary buffer</dfn> lists one line for each article in a single
group.  By default, the author, the subject and the line number are
displayed for each article, but this is customizable, like most aspects
of Gnus display.  The summary buffer is created when you select a group
in the group buffer, and is killed when you exit the group.  Use this
buffer to select an article.

   <p>The <dfn>article buffer</dfn> displays the article.  In normal Gnus usage,
you see this buffer but you don't select it&mdash;all useful
article-oriented commands work in the summary buffer.  But you can
select the article buffer, and execute all Gnus commands from that
buffer, if you want to.
