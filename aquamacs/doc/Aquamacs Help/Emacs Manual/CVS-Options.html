<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.13.3 Options specific for CVS</h5>

<p><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dglobal_002dswitches-2859"></a>  You can specify additional command line options to pass to all CVS
operations in the variable <code>vc-cvs-global-switches</code>.  These
switches are inserted immediately after the <code>cvs</code> command, before
the name of the operation to invoke.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dstay_002dlocal-2860"></a><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dstay_002dlocal-2861"></a><a name="index-remote-repositories-_0028CVS_0029-2862"></a>  When using a CVS repository on a remote machine, VC can try keeping
network interactions to a minimum.  This is controlled by the variable
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code>.  There is another variable,
<code>vc-stay-local</code>, which enables the feature also for other back
ends that support it, including CVS.  In the following, we will talk
only about <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code>, but everything applies to
<code>vc-stay-local</code> as well.

   <p>If <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> is <code>only-file</code> (the default), VC
determines the version control status of each file using only the
entry in the local CVS subdirectory and the information returned by
previous CVS commands.  As a consequence, if you have modified a file
and somebody else has checked in other changes, you will not be
notified of the conflict until you try to commit.

   <p>If you change <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to <code>nil</code>, VC queries the
remote repository <em>before</em> it decides what to do in
<code>vc-next-action</code> (<kbd>C-x v v</kbd>), just as it does for local
repositories.

   <p>You can also set <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to a regular expression
that is matched against the repository host name; VC then stays local
only for repositories from hosts that match the pattern.

   <p><a name="index-automatic-version-backups-2863"></a>  When using a remote repository, Emacs normally makes <dfn>automatic
version backups</dfn> of the original versions of each edited file.  These
local backups are made whenever you save the first changes to a file,
and they are removed after you commit your changes to the repository. 
(Note that these are not the same as ordinary Emacs backup files;
see <a href="Backup.html#Backup">Backup</a>.) 
Commands like <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> and <kbd>C-x v u</kbd> make use of automatic
version backups, if possible, to avoid having to access the network.

   <p>Setting <code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> to <code>nil</code> disables the making
of automatic version backups.

   <p><a name="index-manual-version-backups-2864"></a>  Automatic version backups have names of the form
<var>file</var><code>.~</code><var>version</var><code>.~</code><!-- /@w -->.  This is similar to the name
that <kbd>C-x v ~</kbd> saves old versions to
(see <a href="Old-Revisions.html#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>),
except for the additional dot (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;) after the version.  The
relevant VC commands can use both kinds of version backups.  The main
difference is that the &ldquo;manual&rdquo; version backups made by <kbd>C-x v
~</kbd> are not deleted automatically when you commit.

   <p><a name="index-locking-_0028CVS_0029-2865"></a>  CVS does not use locking by default, but there are ways to enable
locking-like behavior using its <samp><span class="env">CVSREAD</span></samp> or <dfn>watch</dfn> feature;
see the CVS documentation for details.  If that case, you can use
<kbd>C-x v v</kbd> in Emacs to toggle locking, as you would for a
locking-based version control system
(see <a href="VC-With-A-Locking-VCS.html#VC-With-A-Locking-VCS">VC With A Locking VCS</a>).
