<h5 class="subsubsection">18.3.2.1 Single or Numbered Backups</h5>

<p>When Emacs makes a backup file, its name is normally constructed by
appending &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; to the file name being edited; thus, the backup
file for <samp><span class="file">eval.c</span></samp> would be <samp><span class="file">eval.c~</span></samp>.

   <p>If access control stops Emacs from writing backup files under the
usual names, it writes the backup file as <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/%backup%~</span></samp>. 
Only one such file can exist, so only the most recently made such
backup is available.

   <p>Emacs can also make <dfn>numbered backup files</dfn>.  Numbered backup
file names contain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.~</span></samp>&rsquo;, the number, and another &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; after
the original file name.  Thus, the backup files of <samp><span class="file">eval.c</span></samp> would
be called <samp><span class="file">eval.c.~1~</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">eval.c.~2~</span></samp>, and so on, all the way
through names like <samp><span class="file">eval.c.~259~</span></samp> and beyond.

   <p><a name="index-version_002dcontrol-1056"></a>  The variable <code>version-control</code> determines whether to make
single backup files or multiple numbered backup files.  Its possible
values are:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Make numbered backups for files that have numbered backups already. 
Otherwise, make single backups.  This is the default. 
<br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Make numbered backups. 
<br><dt><code>never</code><dd>Never make numbered backups; always make single backups. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">The usual way to set this variable is globally, through your init file
or the customization buffer.  However, you can set
<code>version-control</code> locally in an individual buffer to control the
making of backups for that buffer's file (see <a href="Locals.html#Locals">Locals</a>).  You can
have Emacs set <code>version-control</code> locally whenever you visit a
given file (see <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).  Some modes, such as Rmail mode,
set this variable.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bVERSION_005fCONTROL_007d-environment-variable-1057"></a>  If you set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">VERSION_CONTROL</span></samp>, to tell
various GNU utilities what to do with backup files, Emacs also obeys the
environment variable by setting the Lisp variable <code>version-control</code>
accordingly at startup.  If the environment variable's value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">numbered</span></samp>&rsquo;, then <code>version-control</code> becomes <code>t</code>; if the
value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">existing</span></samp>&rsquo;, then <code>version-control</code>
becomes <code>nil</code>; if it is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">never</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">simple</span></samp>&rsquo;, then
<code>version-control</code> becomes <code>never</code>.

   <p><a name="index-backup_002ddirectory_002dalist-1058"></a>  You can customize the variable <code>backup-directory-alist</code> to
specify that files matching certain patterns should be backed up in
specific directories.  This variable applies to both single and
numbered backups.  A typical use is to add an element <code>("." 
. </code><var>dir</var><code>)</code> to make all backups in the directory with absolute name
<var>dir</var>; Emacs modifies the backup file names to avoid clashes
between files with the same names originating in different
directories.  Alternatively, adding, <code>("." . ".~")</code> would make
backups in the invisible subdirectory <samp><span class="file">.~</span></samp> of the original file's
directory.  Emacs creates the directory, if necessary, to make the
backup.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dbackup_002dfile_002dname_002dfunction-1059"></a>  If you define the variable <code>make-backup-file-name-function</code> to
a suitable Lisp function, that overrides the usual way Emacs
constructs backup file names.
