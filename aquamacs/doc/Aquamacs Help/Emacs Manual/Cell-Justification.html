<h4 class="subsection">29.13.5 Cell Justification</h4>

<p><a name="index-cell-text-justification-1904"></a>
  You can specify text justification for each cell.  The justification
is remembered independently for each cell and the subsequent editing
of cell contents is subject to the specified justification.

   <p><a name="index-table_002djustify-1905"></a>  The command <code>table-justify</code> ask you to specify what to justify:
a cell, a column, or a row.  If you select cell justification, this
command sets the justification only for the current cell.  Selecting
column or row justification sets the justification for all the cells
within a column or row respectively.  The command then ask you which
kind of justification to apply: <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>,
<code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>middle</code>, <code>bottom</code>, or
<code>none</code>.  Horizontal justification and vertical justification are
specified independently.  The options <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, and
<code>right</code> specify horizontal justification while the options
<code>top</code>, <code>middle</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>none</code> specify
vertical justification.  The vertical justification <code>none</code>
effectively removes vertical justification.  Horizontal justification
must be one of <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, or <code>right</code>.

   <p><a name="index-table_002ddetect_002dcell_002dalignment-1906"></a>  Justification information is stored in the buffer as a part of text
property.  Therefore, this information is ephemeral and does not
survive through the loss of the buffer (closing the buffer and
revisiting the buffer erase any previous text properties).  To
countermand for this, the command <code>table-recognize</code> and other
recognition commands (see <a href="Table-Recognition.html#Table-Recognition">Table Recognition</a>) are equipped with a
convenience feature (turned on by default).  During table recognition,
the contents of a cell are examined to determine which justification
was originally applied to the cell and then applies this justification
to the cell.  This is a speculative algorithm and is therefore not
perfect, however, the justification is deduced correctly most of the
time.  To disable this feature, customize the variable
<code>table-detect-cell-alignment</code> and set it to <code>nil</code>.
