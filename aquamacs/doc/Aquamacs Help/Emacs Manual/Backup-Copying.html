<h5 class="subsubsection">18.3.2.3 Copying vs. Renaming</h5>

<p>Backup files can be made by copying the old file or by renaming it. 
This makes a difference when the old file has multiple names (hard
links).  If the old file is renamed into the backup file, then the
alternate names become names for the backup file.  If the old file is
copied instead, then the alternate names remain names for the file
that you are editing, and the contents accessed by those names will be
the new contents.

   <p>The method of making a backup file may also affect the file's owner
and group.  If copying is used, these do not change.  If renaming is used,
you become the file's owner, and the file's group becomes the default
(different operating systems have different defaults for the group).

   <p><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying-1063"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dlinked-1064"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dmismatch-1065"></a><a name="index-backup_002dby_002dcopying_002dwhen_002dprivileged_002dmismatch-1066"></a><a name="index-file-ownership_002c-and-backup-1067"></a><a name="index-backup_002c-and-user_002did-1068"></a>  The choice of renaming or copying is made as follows:

     <ul>
<li>If the variable <code>backup-by-copying</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (the
default is <code>nil</code>), use copying.

     <li>Otherwise, if the variable <code>backup-by-copying-when-linked</code> is
non-<code>nil</code> (the default is <code>nil</code>), and the file has multiple
names, use copying.

     <li>Otherwise, if the variable <code>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</code> is
non-<code>nil</code> (the default is <code>t</code>), and renaming would change
the file's owner or group, use copying.

     <p>If you change <code>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</code> to <code>nil</code>,
Emacs checks the numeric user-id of the file's owner.  If this is
higher than <code>backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch</code>, then it
behaves as though <code>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</code> is
non-<code>nil</code> anyway.

     <li>Otherwise, renaming is the default choice. 
</ul>

   <p>When a file is managed with a version control system (see <a href="Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), Emacs does not normally make backups in the usual way for
that file.  But check-in and check-out are similar in some ways to
making backups.  One unfortunate similarity is that these operations
typically break hard links, disconnecting the file name you visited from
any alternate names for the same file.  This has nothing to do with
Emacs&mdash;the version control system does it.
