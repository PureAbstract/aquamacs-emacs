<h3 class="section">30.8 Shell Commands in Dired</h3>

<p><a name="index-shell-commands_002c-Dired-3146"></a>
<a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dshell_002dcommand-3147"></a><a name="index-g_t_0021-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3148"></a><a name="index-X-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3149"></a>The Dired command <kbd>!</kbd> (<code>dired-do-shell-command</code>) reads a
shell command string in the minibuffer, and runs that shell command on
one or more files.  The files that the shell command operates on are
determined in the usual way for Dired commands (see <a href="Operating-on-Files.html#Operating-on-Files">Operating on Files</a>).  The command <kbd>X</kbd> is a synonym for <kbd>!</kbd>.

   <p>The command <kbd>&amp;</kbd> (<code>dired-do-async-shell-command</code>) does the
same, except that it runs the shell command asynchronously.  (You can
also do this with <kbd>!</kbd>, by appending a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; character to the
end of the shell command.)  When the command operates on more than one
file, it runs multiple parallel copies of the specified shell command,
one for each file.  As an exception, if the specified shell command
ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, the shell command is run in the
background on each file sequentially; Emacs waits for each invoked
shell command to terminate before running the next one.

   <p>For both <kbd>!</kbd> and <kbd>&amp;</kbd>, the working directory for the shell
command is the top-level directory of the Dired buffer.

   <p>If you tell <kbd>!</kbd> or <kbd>&amp;</kbd> to operate on more than one file, the
shell command string determines how those files are passed to the
shell command:

     <ul>
<li>If you use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; surrounded by whitespace in the command string,
then the command runs just once, with the list of file names
substituted for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The order of file names is the order of
appearance in the Dired buffer.

     <p>Thus, <kbd>! tar cf foo.tar * &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> runs <code>tar</code> on the entire
list of file names, putting them into one tar file <samp><span class="file">foo.tar</span></samp>.

     <p>If you want to use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; as a shell wildcard with whitespace around
it, write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*""</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In the shell, this is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;;
but since the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; is not surrounded by whitespace, Dired does not
treat it specially.

     <li>Otherwise, if the command string contains &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; surrounded by
whitespace, Emacs runs the shell command once <em>for each file</em>,
substituting the current file name for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; each time.  You can
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; more than once in the command; the same file name
replaces each occurrence.

     <li>If the command string contains neither &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; nor &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, Emacs
runs the shell command once for each file, adding the file name at the
end.  For example, <kbd>! uudecode &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> runs <code>uudecode</code> on
each file. 
</ul>

   <p>To iterate over the file names in a more complicated fashion, use an
explicit shell loop.  For example, here is how to uuencode each file,
making the output file name by appending &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.uu</span></samp>&rsquo; to the input file
name:

<pre class="example">     for file in * ; do uuencode "$file" "$file" &gt;"$file".uu; done
</pre>
   <p>The <kbd>!</kbd> and <kbd>&amp;</kbd> commands do not attempt to update the Dired
buffer to show new or modified files, because they don't know what
files will be changed.  Use the <kbd>g</kbd> command to update the Dired
buffer (see <a href="Dired-Updating.html#Dired-Updating">Dired Updating</a>).

   <p>See <a href="Single-Shell.html#Single-Shell">Single Shell</a>, for information about running shell commands
outside Dired.
