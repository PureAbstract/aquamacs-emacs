<h3 class="section">27.1 Running Compilations under Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-inferior-process-2542"></a><a name="index-make-2543"></a><a name="index-compilation-errors-2544"></a><a name="index-error-log-2545"></a>
  Emacs can run compilers for languages such as C and Fortran, feeding
the compilation log into an Emacs buffer.  It can also parse the error
messages and show you where the errors occurred.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x compile</kbd><dd>Run a compiler asynchronously under Emacs, with error messages going to
the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x recompile</kbd><dd>Invoke a compiler with the same command as in the last invocation of
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-compilation</kbd><dd>Kill the running compilation subprocess. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-compile-2546"></a>  To run <code>make</code> or another compilation command, type <kbd>M-x
compile</kbd>.  This reads a shell command line using the minibuffer, and
then executes the command by running a shell as a subprocess (or
<dfn>inferior process</dfn>) of Emacs.  The output is inserted in a buffer
named <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp>.  The current buffer's default directory is
used as the working directory for the execution of the command;
normally, therefore, compilation takes place in this directory.

   <p><a name="index-compile_002dcommand-2547"></a>  The default compilation command is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make -k</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is usually
correct for programs compiled using the <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> utility (the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-k</span></samp>&rsquo; flag tells <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> to continue compiling as much as
possible after an error).  See <a href="../make/index.html#Top">Make</a>. 
If you have done <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> before, the command that you
specified is automatically stored in the variable
<code>compile-command</code>; this is used as the default the next time you
type <kbd>M-x compile</kbd>.  A file can also specify a file-local value
for <code>compile-command</code> (see <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).

   <p>Starting a compilation displays the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer in
another window but does not select it.  While the compilation is
running, the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">run</span></samp>&rsquo; is shown in the major mode indicator for
the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer, and the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Compiling</span></samp>&rsquo; appears
in all mode lines.  You do not have to keep the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp>
buffer visible while compilation is running; it continues in any case. 
When the compilation ends, for whatever reason, the mode line of the
<samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer changes to say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">exit</span></samp>&rsquo; (followed by
the exit code: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[0]</span></samp>&rsquo; for a normal exit), or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">signal</span></samp>&rsquo; (if a
signal terminated the process).

   <p>If you want to watch the compilation transcript as it appears,
switch to the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer and move point to the end of
the buffer.  When point is at the end, new compilation output is
inserted above point, which remains at the end.  Otherwise, point
remains fixed while compilation output is added at the end of the
buffer.

   <p><a name="index-compilation-buffer_002c-keeping-point-at-end-2548"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dscroll_002doutput-2549"></a>  If you change the variable <code>compilation-scroll-output</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer scrolls
automatically to follow the output.  If the value is
<code>first-error</code>, scrolling stops when the first error appears,
leaving point at that error.  For any other non-<code>nil</code> value,
scrolling continues until there is no more output.

   <p><a name="index-recompile-2550"></a>  To rerun the last compilation with the same command, type <kbd>M-x
recompile</kbd>.  This reuses the compilation command from the last
invocation of <kbd>M-x compile</kbd>.  It also reuses the
<samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer and starts the compilation in its default
directory, which is the directory in which the previous compilation
was started.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dcompilation-2551"></a><a name="index-compilation_002dalways_002dkill-2552"></a>  Starting a new compilation also kills any compilation already
running in <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp>, as the buffer can only handle one
compilation at any time.  However, <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> asks for
confirmation before actually killing a compilation that is running; to
always automatically kill the compilation without asking, change the
variable <code>compilation-always-kill</code> to <code>t</code>.  You can also
kill a compilation process with the command <kbd>M-x
kill-compilation</kbd>.

   <p>To run two compilations at once, start the first one, then rename
the <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer (perhaps using <code>rename-uniquely</code>;
see <a href="Misc-Buffer.html#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>), then switch buffers and start the other
compilation.  This will create a new <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer.

   <p><a name="index-compilation_002denvironment-2553"></a>  You can control the environment passed to the compilation command
with the variable <code>compilation-environment</code>.  Its value is a list
of environment variable settings; each element should be a string of
the form <code>"</code><var>envvarname</var><code>=</code><var>value</var><code>"</code>.  These environment
variable settings override the usual ones.
