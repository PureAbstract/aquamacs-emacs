<h3 class="section">36.1 Single Shell Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-M_002d_0021-3916"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand-3917"></a>  <kbd>M-!</kbd> (<code>shell-command</code>) reads a line of text using the
minibuffer and executes it as a shell command, in a subshell made just
for that command.  Standard input for the command comes from the null
device.  If the shell command produces any output, the output appears
either in the echo area (if it is short), or in an Emacs buffer named
<samp><span class="file">*Shell Command Output*</span></samp>, displayed in another window (if the
output is long).

   <p>For instance, one way to decompress a file named <samp><span class="file">foo.gz</span></samp> is to
type <kbd>M-! gunzip foo.gz &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  That shell command normally
creates the file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> and produces no terminal output.

   <p>A numeric argument to <code>shell-command</code>, e.g., <kbd>M-1 M-!</kbd>,
causes it to insert terminal output into the current buffer instead of
a separate buffer.  It puts point before the output, and sets the mark
after the output.  For instance, <kbd>M-1 M-! gunzip &lt; foo.gz
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> would insert the uncompressed form of the file
<samp><span class="file">foo.gz</span></samp> into the current buffer.

   <p>Provided the specified shell command does not end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, it
runs <dfn>synchronously</dfn>, and you must wait for it to exit before
continuing to use Emacs.  To stop waiting, type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to quit;
this sends a <code>SIGINT</code> signal to terminate the shell command (this
is the same signal that <kbd>C-c</kbd> normally generates in the shell). 
Emacs then waits until the command actually terminates.  If the shell
command doesn't stop (because it ignores the <code>SIGINT</code> signal),
type <kbd>C-g</kbd> again; this sends the command a <code>SIGKILL</code> signal,
which is impossible to ignore.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0026-3918"></a><a name="index-async_002dshell_002dcommand-3919"></a>  A shell command that ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; is executed
<dfn>asynchronously</dfn>, and you can continue to use Emacs as it runs. 
You can also type <kbd>M-&amp;</kbd> (<code>async-shell-command</code>) to execute a
shell command asynchronously; this is exactly like calling <kbd>M-!</kbd>
with a trailing &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, except that you do not need the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The default output buffer for asynchronous shell commands is named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Async Shell Command*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Emacs inserts the output into this
buffer as it comes in, whether or not the buffer is visible in a
window.

   <p><a name="index-async_002dshell_002dcommand_002dbuffer-3920"></a>  If you want to run more than one asynchronous shell command at the
same time, they could end up competing for the output buffer.  The
option <code>async-shell-command-buffer</code> specifies what to do about
this; e.g., whether to rename the pre-existing output buffer, or to
use a different buffer for the new command.  Consult the variable's
documentation for more possibilities.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_007c-3921"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand_002don_002dregion-3922"></a>  <kbd>M-|</kbd> (<code>shell-command-on-region</code>) is like <kbd>M-!</kbd>, but
passes the contents of the region as the standard input to the shell
command, instead of no input.  With a numeric argument, it deletes the
old region and replaces it with the output from the shell command.

   <p>For example, you can use <kbd>M-|</kbd> with the <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp> program to
see what keys are in the buffer.  If the buffer contains a GnuPG key,
type <kbd>C-x h M-| gpg &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to feed the entire buffer contents
to <samp><span class="command">gpg</span></samp>.  This will output the list of keys to the
<samp><span class="file">*Shell Command Output*</span></samp> buffer.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dfile_002dname-3923"></a>  The above commands use the shell specified by the variable
<code>shell-file-name</code>.  Its default value is determined by the
<samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> environment variable when Emacs is started.  If the file
name is relative, Emacs searches the directories listed in
<code>exec-path</code> (see <a href="Shell.html#Shell">Shell</a>).

   <p>To specify a coding system for <kbd>M-!</kbd> or <kbd>M-|</kbd>, use the command
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd> immediately beforehand.  See <a href="Communication-Coding.html#Communication-Coding">Communication Coding</a>.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dcommand_002ddefault_002derror_002dbuffer-3924"></a>  By default, error output is intermixed with the regular output in
the output buffer.  But if you change the value of the variable
<code>shell-command-default-error-buffer</code> to a string, error output is
inserted into a buffer of that name.
