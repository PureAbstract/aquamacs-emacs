<h3 class="section">41.1 Single Shell Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-M_002d_0021-3575"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand-3576"></a>  <kbd>M-!</kbd> (<code>shell-command</code>) reads a line of text using the
minibuffer and executes it as a shell command in a subshell made just
for that command.  Standard input for the command comes from the null
device.  If the shell command produces any output, the output appears
either in the echo area (if it is short), or in an Emacs buffer named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Shell Command Output*</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is displayed in another window
but not selected (if the output is long).

   <p>For instance, one way to decompress a file <samp><span class="file">foo.gz</span></samp> from Emacs
is to type <kbd>M-! gunzip foo.gz &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  That shell command
normally creates the file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> and produces no terminal output.

   <p>A numeric argument, as in <kbd>M-1 M-!</kbd>, says to insert terminal
output into the current buffer instead of a separate buffer.  It puts
point before the output, and sets the mark after the output.  For
instance, <kbd>M-1 M-! gunzip &lt; foo.gz &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> would insert the
uncompressed equivalent of <samp><span class="file">foo.gz</span></samp> into the current buffer.

   <p>If the shell command line ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, it runs asynchronously. 
For a synchronous shell command, <code>shell-command</code> returns the
command's exit status (0 means success), when it is called from a Lisp
program.  You do not get any status information for an asynchronous
command, since it hasn't finished yet when <code>shell-command</code> returns.

   <p>You can also type <kbd>M-&amp;</kbd> (<code>async-shell-command</code>) to execute
a shell command asynchronously.  This behaves exactly like calling
<code>shell-command</code> with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, except that you do not need to add
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; to the shell command line.

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_007c-3577"></a><a name="index-shell_002dcommand_002don_002dregion-3578"></a>  <kbd>M-|</kbd> (<code>shell-command-on-region</code>) is like <kbd>M-!</kbd> but
passes the contents of the region as the standard input to the shell
command, instead of no input.  With a numeric argument, meaning insert
the output in the current buffer, it deletes the old region and the
output replaces it as the contents of the region.  It returns the
command's exit status, like <kbd>M-!</kbd>.

   <p>One use for <kbd>M-|</kbd> is to run <code>gpg</code> to see what keys are in
the buffer.  For instance, if the buffer contains a GPG key, type
<kbd>C-x h M-| gpg &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to feed the entire buffer contents to
the <code>gpg</code> program.  That program will ignore everything except
the encoded keys, and will output a list of the keys the buffer
contains.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dfile_002dname-3579"></a>  Both <kbd>M-!</kbd> and <kbd>M-|</kbd> use <code>shell-file-name</code> to specify
the shell to use.  This variable is initialized based on your
<samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> environment variable when Emacs is started.  If the file
name is relative, Emacs searches the directories in the list
<code>exec-path</code>; this list is initialized based on the environment
variable <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> when Emacs is started.  Your init file can
override either or both of these default initializations (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).

   <p>Both <kbd>M-!</kbd> and <kbd>M-|</kbd> wait for the shell command to complete,
unless you end the command with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; to make it asynchronous.  To
stop waiting, type <kbd>C-g</kbd> to quit; that terminates the shell
command with the signal <code>SIGINT</code>&mdash;the same signal that <kbd>C-c</kbd>
normally generates in the shell.  Emacs then waits until the command
actually terminates.  If the shell command doesn't stop (because it
ignores the <code>SIGINT</code> signal), type <kbd>C-g</kbd> again; this sends
the command a <code>SIGKILL</code> signal which is impossible to ignore.

   <p>Asynchronous commands ending in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; feed their output into
the buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Async Shell Command*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Output arrives in that
buffer regardless of whether it is visible in a window.

   <p>To specify a coding system for <kbd>M-!</kbd> or <kbd>M-|</kbd>, use the command
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd> immediately beforehand.  See <a href="Communication-Coding.html#Communication-Coding">Communication Coding</a>.

   <p><a name="index-shell_002dcommand_002ddefault_002derror_002dbuffer-3580"></a>  Error output from these commands is normally intermixed with the
regular output.  But if the variable
<code>shell-command-default-error-buffer</code> has a string as value, and
it's the name of a buffer, <kbd>M-!</kbd> and <kbd>M-|</kbd> insert error output
before point in that buffer.
