<h3 class="section">24.1 Concepts of Emacs Windows</h3>

<p>Each Emacs window displays one Emacs buffer at any time.  A single
buffer may appear in more than one window; if it does, any changes in
its text are displayed in all the windows where it appears.  But these
windows can show different parts of the buffer, because each window
has its own value of point.

   <p><a name="index-selected-window-1131"></a>  At any time, one Emacs window is the <dfn>selected window</dfn>; the
buffer this window is displaying is the current buffer.  The terminal's
cursor shows the location of point in this window.  Each other window
has a location of point as well.  On text-only terminals, there is no
way to show where those locations are, since the terminal has only one
cursor.  On a graphical display, the location of point in a
non-selected window is indicated by a hollow box; the cursor in the
selected window is blinking or solid.

   <p>Commands to move point affect the value of point for the selected Emacs
window only.  They do not change the value of point in other Emacs
windows, even those showing the same buffer.  The same is true for commands
such as <kbd>C-x b</kbd> to switch buffers in the selected window;
they do not affect other windows at all.  However, there are other commands
such as <kbd>C-x 4 b</kbd> that select a different window and switch buffers in
it.  Also, all commands that display information in a window, including
(for example) <kbd>C-h f</kbd> (<code>describe-function</code>) and <kbd>C-x C-b</kbd>
(<code>list-buffers</code>), work by switching buffers in a nonselected window
without affecting the selected window.

   <p>When multiple windows show the same buffer, they can have different
regions, because they can have different values of point.  However,
they all have the same value for the mark, because each buffer has
only one mark position.

   <p>Each window has its own mode line, which displays the buffer name,
modification status and major and minor modes of the buffer that is
displayed in the window.  The selected window's mode line appears in a
different color.  See <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>, for full details on the mode line.
