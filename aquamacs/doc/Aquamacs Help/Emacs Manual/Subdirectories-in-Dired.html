<h3 class="section">30.11 Subdirectories in Dired</h3>

<p><a name="index-subdirectories-in-Dired-3168"></a><a name="index-expanding-subdirectories-in-Dired-3169"></a>
  A Dired buffer usually displays just one directory, but you can
optionally include its subdirectories as well.

   <p>The simplest way to include multiple directories in one Dired buffer is
to specify the options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lR</span></samp>&rsquo; for running <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>.  (If you give a
numeric argument when you run Dired, then you can specify these options
in the minibuffer.)  That produces a recursive directory listing showing
all subdirectories at all levels.

   <p>More often, you will want to show only specific subdirectories.  You
can do this with <kbd>i</kbd> (<code>dired-maybe-insert-subdir</code>):

     
<a name="index-dired_002dmaybe_002dinsert_002dsubdir-3170"></a>
<a name="index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3171"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>i</kbd><dd><a name="index-inserted-subdirectory-_0028Dired_0029-3172"></a><a name="index-in_002dsitu-subdirectory-_0028Dired_0029-3173"></a>Insert the contents of a subdirectory later in the buffer. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">If you use this command on a line that describes a file which is a
directory, it inserts the contents of that directory into the same
Dired buffer, and moves there.  Inserted subdirectory contents follow
the top-level directory of the Dired buffer, just as they do in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls -lR</span></samp>&rsquo; output.

   <p>If the subdirectory's contents are already present in the buffer,
the <kbd>i</kbd> command just moves to it.

   <p>In either case, <kbd>i</kbd> sets the Emacs mark before moving, so
<kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> returns to your previous position in the Dired
buffer (see <a href="Setting-Mark.html#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).  You can also use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; to return to
the parent directory in the same Dired buffer (see <a href="Dired-Visiting.html#Dired-Visiting">Dired Visiting</a>).

   <p>Use the <kbd>l</kbd> command (<code>dired-do-redisplay</code>) to update the
subdirectory's contents, and use <kbd>C-u k</kbd> on the subdirectory
header line to remove the subdirectory listing (see <a href="Dired-Updating.html#Dired-Updating">Dired Updating</a>).  You can also hide and show inserted subdirectories
(see <a href="Hiding-Subdirectories.html#Hiding-Subdirectories">Hiding Subdirectories</a>).
