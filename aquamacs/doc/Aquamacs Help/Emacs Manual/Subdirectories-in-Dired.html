<h3 class="section">37.11 Subdirectories in Dired</h3>

<p><a name="index-subdirectories-in-Dired-3117"></a><a name="index-expanding-subdirectories-in-Dired-3118"></a>
  A Dired buffer displays just one directory in the normal case;
but you can optionally include its subdirectories as well.

   <p>The simplest way to include multiple directories in one Dired buffer is
to specify the options &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lR</span></samp>&rsquo; for running <code>ls</code>.  (If you give a
numeric argument when you run Dired, then you can specify these options
in the minibuffer.)  That produces a recursive directory listing showing
all subdirectories at all levels.

   <p>More often, you will want to show only specific subdirectories.  You
can do this with the <kbd>i</kbd> command:

     
<a name="index-dired_002dmaybe_002dinsert_002dsubdir-3119"></a>
<a name="index-i-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3120"></a>
<dl><dt><kbd>i</kbd><dd><a name="index-inserted-subdirectory-_0028Dired_0029-3121"></a><a name="index-in_002dsitu-subdirectory-_0028Dired_0029-3122"></a>Insert the contents of a subdirectory later in the buffer. 
</dl>

   <p>Use the <kbd>i</kbd> (<code>dired-maybe-insert-subdir</code>) command on a line
that describes a file which is a directory.  It inserts the contents of
that directory into the same Dired buffer, and moves there.  Inserted
subdirectory contents follow the top-level directory of the Dired
buffer, just as they do in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls -lR</span></samp>&rsquo; output.

   <p>If the subdirectory's contents are already present in the buffer, the
<kbd>i</kbd> command just moves to it.

   <p>In either case, <kbd>i</kbd> sets the Emacs mark before moving, so <kbd>C-u
C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> takes you back to the old position in the buffer (the line
describing that subdirectory).  You can also use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; to return
to the parent directory in the same Dired buffer.

   <p>Use the <kbd>l</kbd> command (<code>dired-do-redisplay</code>) to update the
subdirectory's contents.  Use <kbd>C-u k</kbd> on the subdirectory header
line to delete the subdirectory (see <a href="Dired-Updating.html#Dired-Updating">Dired Updating</a>).  You can also
hide and show inserted subdirectories (see <a href="Hiding-Subdirectories.html#Hiding-Subdirectories">Hiding Subdirectories</a>).
