<h3 class="section">27.8 Libraries of Lisp Code for Emacs</h3>

<p><a name="index-libraries-2691"></a><a name="index-loading-Lisp-code-2692"></a>
  Emacs Lisp code is stored in files whose names conventionally end in
<samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp>.  Such files are automatically visited in Emacs Lisp mode.

   <p><a name="index-byte-code-2693"></a>  Emacs Lisp code can be compiled into byte-code, which loads faster,
takes up less space, and executes faster.  By convention, compiled
Emacs Lisp code goes in a separate file whose name ends in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For example, the compiled code for <samp><span class="file">foo.el</span></samp> goes in
<samp><span class="file">foo.elc</span></samp>.  See <a href="../elisp/Byte-Compilation.html#Byte-Compilation">Byte Compilation</a>.

   <p><a name="index-load_002dfile-2694"></a>  To <dfn>load</dfn> an Emacs Lisp file, type <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd>.  This
command reads a file name using the minibuffer, and executes the
contents of that file as Emacs Lisp code.  It is not necessary to
visit the file first; this command reads the file directly from disk,
not from an existing Emacs buffer.

   <p><a name="index-load-2695"></a><a name="index-load_002dlibrary-2696"></a><a name="index-load-path-for-Emacs-Lisp-2697"></a>  If an Emacs Lisp file is installed in the Emacs Lisp <dfn>load path</dfn>
(defined below), you can load it by typing <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd>,
instead of using <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd>.  The <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd>
command prompts for a <dfn>library name</dfn> rather than a file name; it
searches through each directory in the Emacs Lisp load path, trying to
find a file matching that library name.  If the library name is
&lsquo;<samp><var>foo</var></samp>&rsquo;, it tries looking for files named
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp>, <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.el</span></samp>, and lastly just
<samp><var>foo</var></samp>; the first one found is loaded.  This command prefers
<samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> files over <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> files because compiled files load
and run faster.  If it finds that <samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.el</span></samp> is newer than
<samp><var>lib</var><span class="file">.elc</span></samp>, it issues a warning, in case someone made
changes to the <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file and forgot to recompile it, but loads
the <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> file anyway.  (Due to this behavior, you can save
unfinished edits to Emacs Lisp source files, and not recompile until
your changes are ready for use.)

   <p>Emacs Lisp programs usually load Emacs Lisp files using the
<code>load</code> function.  This is similar to <code>load-library</code>, but is
lower-level and accepts additional arguments.  See <a href="../elisp/How-Programs-Do-Loading.html#How-Programs-Do-Loading">How Programs Do Loading</a>.

   <p><a name="index-load_002dpath-2698"></a>  The Emacs Lisp load path is specified by the variable
<code>load-path</code>.  Its value should be a list of directory names
(strings).  These directories are searched, in the specified order, by
the <kbd>M-x load-library</kbd> command, the lower-level <code>load</code>
function, and other Emacs functions that find Emacs Lisp libraries.  A
list entry in <code>load-path</code> can also have the special value
<code>nil</code>, which stands for the current default directory, but it is
almost always a bad idea to use this.  (If you find yourself wishing
that <code>nil</code> were in the list, most likely what you really want is
to use <kbd>M-x load-file</kbd>.)

   <p>The default value of <code>load-path</code> is a list of directories where
the Lisp code for Emacs itself is stored.  If you have libraries of
your own in another directory, you can add that directory to the load
path.  Unlike most other variables described in this manual,
<code>load-path</code> cannot be changed via the Customize interface
(see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), but you can add a directory to it by
putting a line like this in your init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/my/lisp/library")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-autoload-2699"></a>  Some commands are <dfn>autoloaded</dfn>; when you run them, Emacs
automatically loads the associated library first.  For instance, the
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd> command (see <a href="Compilation.html#Compilation">Compilation</a>) is autoloaded; if you
call it, Emacs automatically loads the <code>compile</code> library first. 
In contrast, the command <kbd>M-x recompile</kbd> is not autoloaded, so it
is unavailable until you load the <code>compile</code> library.

   <p><a name="index-help_002denable_002dauto_002dload-2700"></a>  Automatic loading can also occur when you look up the documentation
of an autoloaded command (see <a href="Name-Help.html#Name-Help">Name Help</a>), if the documentation
refers to other functions and variables in its library (loading the
library lets Emacs properly set up the hyperlinks in the <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp>
buffer).  To disable this feature, change the variable
<code>help-enable-auto-load</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-load_002ddangerous_002dlibraries-2701"></a><a name="index-Lisp-files-byte_002dcompiled-by-XEmacs-2702"></a>  By default, Emacs refuses to load compiled Lisp files which were
compiled with XEmacs, a modified versions of Emacs&mdash;they can cause
Emacs to crash.  Set the variable <code>load-dangerous-libraries</code> to
<code>t</code> if you want to try loading them.
