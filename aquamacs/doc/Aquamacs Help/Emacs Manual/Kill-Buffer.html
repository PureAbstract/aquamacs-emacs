<h3 class="section">19.4 Killing Buffers</h3>

<p><a name="index-killing-buffers-1290"></a>  If you continue an Emacs session for a while, you may accumulate a
large number of buffers.  You may then find it convenient to <dfn>kill</dfn>
the buffers you no longer need.  On most operating systems, killing a
buffer releases its space back to the operating system so that other
programs can use it.  Here are some commands for killing buffers:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x k </kbd><var>bufname</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd><dd>Kill buffer <var>bufname</var> (<code>kill-buffer</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-some-buffers</kbd><dd>Offer to kill each buffer, one by one. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-matching-buffers</kbd><dd>Offer to kill all buffers matching a regular expression. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dbuffer-1291"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-k-1292"></a>  <kbd>C-x k</kbd> (<code>kill-buffer</code>) kills one buffer, whose name you
specify in the minibuffer.  The default, used if you type just
&lt;RET&gt; in the minibuffer, is to kill the current buffer.  If you
kill the current buffer, another buffer becomes current: one that was
current in the recent past but is not displayed in any window now.  If
you ask to kill a file-visiting buffer that is modified, then you must
confirm with <kbd>yes</kbd> before the buffer is killed.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dsome_002dbuffers-1293"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x kill-some-buffers</kbd> asks about each buffer, one
by one.  An answer of <kbd>y</kbd> means to kill the buffer, just like
<code>kill-buffer</code>.  This command ignores buffers whose names begin
with a space, which are used internally by Emacs.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dmatching_002dbuffers-1294"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x kill-matching-buffers</kbd> prompts for a regular
expression and kills all buffers whose names match that expression. 
See <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>.  Like <code>kill-some-buffers</code>, it asks for
confirmation before each kill.  This command normally ignores buffers
whose names begin with a space, which are used internally by Emacs. 
To kill internal buffers as well, call <code>kill-matching-buffers</code>
with a prefix argument.

   <p>The Buffer Menu feature is also convenient for killing various
buffers.  See <a href="Several-Buffers.html#Several-Buffers">Several Buffers</a>.

   <p><a name="index-kill_002dbuffer_002dhook-1295"></a>  If you want to do something special every time a buffer is killed, you
can add hook functions to the hook <code>kill-buffer-hook</code> (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p><a name="index-clean_002dbuffer_002dlist-1296"></a>  If you run one Emacs session for a period of days, as many people do,
it can fill up with buffers that you used several days ago.  The command
<kbd>M-x clean-buffer-list</kbd> is a convenient way to purge them; it kills
all the unmodified buffers that you have not used for a long time.  An
ordinary buffer is killed if it has not been displayed for three days;
however, you can specify certain buffers that should never be killed
automatically, and others that should be killed if they have been unused
for a mere hour.

   <p><a name="index-Midnight-mode-1297"></a><a name="index-midnight_002dmode-1298"></a><a name="index-midnight_002dhook-1299"></a>  You can also have this buffer purging done for you, once a day,
by enabling Midnight mode.  Midnight mode operates each day
at midnight; at that time, it runs <code>clean-buffer-list</code>, or
whichever functions you have placed in the normal hook
<code>midnight-hook</code> (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>).  To enable Midnight mode, use
the Customization buffer to set the variable <code>midnight-mode</code> to
<code>t</code>.  See <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>.
