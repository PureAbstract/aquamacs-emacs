<h3 class="section">50.6 When Emacs Crashes</h3>

<p><a name="index-crash-report-4489"></a><a name="index-backtrace-4490"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bemacs_005fbacktrace_002etxt_007d-file_002c-MS_002dWindows-4491"></a>  Emacs is not supposed to crash, but if it does, it produces a
<dfn>crash report</dfn> prior to exiting.  The crash report is printed to
the standard error stream.  If Emacs was started from a graphical
desktop on a GNU or Unix system, the standard error stream is commonly
redirected to a file such as <samp><span class="file">~/.xsession-errors</span></samp>, so you can
look for the crash report there.  On MS-Windows, the crash report is
written to a file named <samp><span class="file">emacs_backtrace.txt</span></samp> in the current
directory of the Emacs process, in addition to the standard error
stream.

   <p>The format of the crash report depends on the platform.  On some
platforms, such as those using the GNU C Library, the crash report
includes a <dfn>backtrace</dfn> describing the execution state prior to
crashing, which can be used to help debug the crash.  Here is an
example for a GNU system:

<pre class="example">     Fatal error 11: Segmentation fault
     Backtrace:
     emacs[0x5094e4]
     emacs[0x4ed3e6]
     emacs[0x4ed504]
     /lib64/libpthread.so.0[0x375220efe0]
     /lib64/libpthread.so.0(read+0xe)[0x375220e08e]
     emacs[0x509af6]
     emacs[0x5acc26]
     ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The number &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">11</span></samp>&rsquo; is the system signal number corresponding to the
crash&mdash;in this case a segmentation fault.  The hexadecimal numbers
are program addresses, which can be associated with source code lines
using a debugging tool.  For example, the GDB command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">list *0x509af6</span></samp>&rsquo; prints the source-code lines corresponding to
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs[0x509af6]</span></samp>&rsquo; entry.  If your system has the
<samp><span class="command">addr2line</span></samp> utility, the following shell command outputs a
backtrace with source-code line numbers:

<pre class="example">     sed -n 's/.*\[\(.*\)]$/\1/p' <var>backtrace</var> |
       addr2line -C -f -i -p -e <var>bindir</var>/<var>emacs-binary</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here, <var>backtrace</var> is the name of a text file containing a copy of
the backtrace, <var>bindir</var> is the name of the directory that
contains the Emacs executable, and <var>emacs-binary</var> is the name of
the Emacs executable file, normally <samp><span class="file">emacs</span></samp> on GNU and Unix
systems and <samp><span class="file">emacs.exe</span></samp> on MS-Windows and MS-DOS.  Omit the
<samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option if your version of <samp><span class="command">addr2line</span></samp> is too old
to have it.

   <p><a name="index-core-dump-4492"></a>  Optionally, Emacs can generate a <dfn>core dump</dfn> when it crashes, on
systems that support core files.  A core dump is a file containing
voluminous data about the state of the program prior to the crash,
usually examined by loading it into a debugger such as GDB.  On many
platforms, core dumps are disabled by default, and you must explicitly
enable them by running the shell command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ulimit -c unlimited</span></samp>&rsquo;
(e.g., in your shell startup script).
