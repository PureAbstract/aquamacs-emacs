<h4 class="subsection">G.12.2 Mouse Usage on MS-DOS</h4>

<p><a name="index-mouse-support-under-MS_002dDOS-4825"></a>  Emacs on MS-DOS supports a mouse (on the default terminal only). 
The mouse commands work as documented, including those that use menus
and the menu bar
(see <a href="Menu-Bar.html#Menu-Bar">Menu Bar</a>). 
 Scroll bars don't work in MS-DOS Emacs.  PC mice usually have only
two buttons; these act as <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> and <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd>, but if you
press both of them together, that has the effect of <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd>.  If
the mouse does have 3 buttons, Emacs detects that at startup, and all
the 3 buttons function normally, as on X.

   <p>Help strings for menu-bar and pop-up menus are displayed in the echo
area when the mouse pointer moves across the menu items.  Highlighting
of mouse-sensitive text
(see <a href="Mouse-References.html#Mouse-References">Mouse References</a>)
is also supported.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002c-set-number-of-buttons-4826"></a><a name="index-msdos_002dset_002dmouse_002dbuttons-4827"></a>  Some versions of mouse drivers don't report the number of mouse
buttons correctly.  For example, mice with a wheel report that they
have 3 buttons, but only 2 of them are passed to Emacs; the clicks on
the wheel, which serves as the middle button, are not passed.  In
these cases, you can use the <kbd>M-x msdos-set-mouse-buttons</kbd> command
to tell Emacs how many mouse buttons to expect.  You could make such a
setting permanent by adding this fragment to your <samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> init
file:

<pre class="example">     ;; <span class="roman">Treat the mouse like a 2-button mouse.</span>
     (msdos-set-mouse-buttons 2)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Windows-clipboard-support-4828"></a>  Emacs built for MS-DOS supports clipboard operations when it runs on
Windows.  Commands that put text on the kill ring, or yank text from
the ring, check the Windows clipboard first, just as Emacs does on the
X Window System
(see <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>). 
Only the primary selection and the cut buffer are supported by MS-DOS
Emacs on Windows; the secondary selection always appears as empty.

   <p>Due to the way clipboard access is implemented by Windows, the
length of text you can put into the clipboard is limited by the amount
of free DOS memory that is available to Emacs.  Usually, up to 620KB of
text can be put into the clipboard, but this limit depends on the system
configuration and is lower if you run Emacs as a subprocess of
another program.  If the killed text does not fit, Emacs outputs a
message saying so, and does not put the text into the clipboard.

   <p>Null characters also cannot be put into the Windows clipboard.  If the
killed text includes null characters, Emacs does not put such text into
the clipboard, and displays in the echo area a message to that effect.

   <p><a name="index-dos_002ddisplay_002dscancodes-4829"></a>  The variable <code>dos-display-scancodes</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>,
directs Emacs to display the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> value and the keyboard scan code of
each keystroke; this feature serves as a complement to the
<code>view-lossage</code> command, for debugging.
