<h3 class="section">14.3 Automatic Scrolling</h3>

<p><a name="index-automatic-scrolling-573"></a>  Emacs performs <dfn>automatic scrolling</dfn> when point moves out of the
visible portion of the text.  Normally, automatic scrolling centers
point vertically in the window, but there are several ways to alter
this behavior.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dconservatively-574"></a>  If you set <code>scroll-conservatively</code> to a small number <var>n</var>,
then moving point just a little off the screen (no more than <var>n</var>
lines) causes Emacs to scroll just enough to bring point back on
screen; if doing so fails to make point visible, Emacs scrolls just
far enough to center point in the window.  If you set
<code>scroll-conservatively</code> to a large number (larger than 100),
automatic scrolling never centers point, no matter how far point
moves; Emacs always scrolls text just enough to bring point into view,
either at the top or bottom of the window depending on the scroll
direction.  By default, <code>scroll-conservatively</code> is&nbsp;0, which
means to always center point in the window.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dstep-575"></a>  Another way to control automatic scrolling is to customize the
variable <code>scroll-step</code>.  Its value determines the number of lines
by which to automatically scroll, when point moves off the screen.  If
scrolling by that number of lines fails to bring point back into view,
point is centered instead.  The default value is zero, which (by
default) causes point to always be centered after scrolling.

   <p><a name="index-aggressive-scrolling-576"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dup_002daggressively-577"></a><a name="index-scroll_002ddown_002daggressively-578"></a>  A third way to control automatic scrolling is to customize the
variables <code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> and
<code>scroll-down-aggressively</code>, which directly specify the vertical
position of point after scrolling.  The value of
<code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> should be either <code>nil</code> (the
default), or a floating point number <var>f</var> between 0 and 1.  The
latter means that when point goes below the bottom window edge (i.e.,
scrolling forward), Emacs scrolls the window so that point is <var>f</var>
parts of the window height from the bottom window edge.  Thus, larger
<var>f</var> means more aggressive scrolling: more new text is brought into
view.  The default value, <code>nil</code>, is equivalent to 0.5.

   <p>Likewise, <code>scroll-down-aggressively</code> is used when point goes
above the bottom window edge (i.e., scrolling backward).  The value
specifies how far point should be from the top margin of the window
after scrolling.  Thus, as with <code>scroll-up-aggressively</code>, a
larger value is more aggressive.

   <p>Note that the variables <code>scroll-conservatively</code>,
<code>scroll-step</code>, and <code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> /
<code>scroll-down-aggressively</code> control automatic scrolling in
contradictory ways.  Therefore, you should pick no more than one of
these methods to customize automatic scrolling.  In case you customize
multiple variables, the order of priority is:
<code>scroll-conservatively</code>, then <code>scroll-step</code>, and finally
<code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> / <code>scroll-down-aggressively</code>.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dmargin-579"></a>  The variable <code>scroll-margin</code> restricts how close point can come
to the top or bottom of a window (even if aggressive scrolling
specifies a fraction <var>f</var> that is larger than the window portion
between the top and the bottom margins).  Its value is a number of screen
lines; if point comes within that many lines of the top or bottom of
the window, Emacs performs automatic scrolling.  By default,
<code>scroll-margin</code> is 0.
