<h3 class="section">48.2 Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-variable-4360"></a>
  A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a Lisp symbol which has a value.  The symbol's
name is also called the <dfn>variable name</dfn>.  A variable name can
contain any characters that can appear in a file, but most variable
names consist of ordinary words separated by hyphens.

   <p>The name of the variable serves as a compact description of its
role.  Most variables also have a <dfn>documentation string</dfn>, which
describes what the variable's purpose is, what kind of value it should
have, and how the value will be used.  You can view this documentation
using the help command <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>). 
See <a href="Examining.html#Examining">Examining</a>.

   <p>Emacs uses many Lisp variables for internal record keeping, but the
most interesting variables for a non-programmer user are those meant
for users to change&mdash;these are called <dfn>customizable variables</dfn> or
<dfn>user options</dfn> (see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).  In the following
sections, we will describe other aspects of Emacs variables, such as
how to set them outside Customize.

   <p>Emacs Lisp allows any variable (with a few exceptions) to have any
kind of value.  However, many variables are meaningful only if
assigned values of a certain type.  For example, only numbers are
meaningful values for <code>kill-ring-max</code>, which specifies the
maximum length of the kill ring (see <a href="Earlier-Kills.html#Earlier-Kills">Earlier Kills</a>); if you give
<code>kill-ring-max</code> a string value, commands such as <kbd>C-y</kbd>
(<code>yank</code>) will signal an error.  On the other hand, some variables
don't care about type; for instance, if a variable has one effect for
<code>nil</code> values and another effect for &ldquo;non-<code>nil</code>&rdquo; values,
then any value that is not the symbol <code>nil</code> induces the second
effect, regardless of its type (by convention, we usually use the
value <code>t</code>&mdash;a symbol which stands for &ldquo;true&rdquo;&mdash;to specify a
non-<code>nil</code> value).  If you set a variable using the customization
buffer, you need not worry about giving it an invalid type: the
customization buffer usually only allows you to enter meaningful
values.  When in doubt, use <kbd>C-h v</kbd> (<code>describe-variable</code>) to
check the variable's documentation string to see kind of value it
expects (see <a href="Examining.html#Examining">Examining</a>).
