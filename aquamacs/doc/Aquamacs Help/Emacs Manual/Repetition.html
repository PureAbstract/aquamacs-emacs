<h3 class="section">8.5 Repeating Minibuffer Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-command-history-197"></a><a name="index-history-of-commands-198"></a>
  Every command that uses the minibuffer once is recorded on a special
history list, the <dfn>command history</dfn>, together with the values of
its arguments, so that you can repeat the entire command.  In
particular, every use of <kbd>M-x</kbd> is recorded there, since <kbd>M-x</kbd>
uses the minibuffer to read the command name.

   <p><a name="index-list_002dcommand_002dhistory-199"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd><dd>Re-execute a recent minibuffer command from the command history
 (<code>repeat-complex-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x list-command-history</kbd><dd>Display the entire command history, showing all the commands
<kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> can repeat, most recent first. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-ESC-ESC-200"></a><a name="index-repeat_002dcomplex_002dcommand-201"></a>  <kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> is used to re-execute a recent command
that used the minibuffer.  With no argument, it repeats the last such
command.  A numeric argument specifies which command to repeat; 1
means the last one, 2 the previous, and so on.

   <p><kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd> works by turning the previous command
into a Lisp expression and then entering a minibuffer initialized with
the text for that expression.  Even if you don't understand Lisp
syntax, it will probably be obvious which command is displayed for
repetition.  If you type just &lt;RET&gt;, that repeats the command
unchanged.  You can also change the command by editing the Lisp
expression before you execute it.  The repeated command is added to
the front of the command history unless it is identical to the most
recent item.

   <p>Once inside the minibuffer for <kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>, you can
use the minibuffer history commands (<kbd>M-p</kbd>, <kbd>M-n</kbd>, <kbd>M-r</kbd>,
<kbd>M-s</kbd>; see <a href="Minibuffer-History.html#Minibuffer-History">Minibuffer History</a>) to move through the history list
of saved entire commands.  After finding the desired previous command,
you can edit its expression as usual and then repeat it by typing
&lt;RET&gt;.

   <p><a name="index-isearch_002dresume_002din_002dcommand_002dhistory-202"></a>  Incremental search does not, strictly speaking, use the minibuffer. 
Therefore, although it behaves like a complex command, it normally
does not appear in the history list for <kbd>C-x &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>. 
You can make incremental search commands appear in the history by
setting <code>isearch-resume-in-command-history</code> to a non-<code>nil</code>
value.  See <a href="Incremental-Search.html#Incremental-Search">Incremental Search</a>.

   <p><a name="index-command_002dhistory-203"></a>  The list of previous minibuffer-using commands is stored as a Lisp
list in the variable <code>command-history</code>.  Each element is a Lisp
expression which describes one command and its arguments.  Lisp programs
can re-execute a command by calling <code>eval</code> with the
<code>command-history</code> element.
