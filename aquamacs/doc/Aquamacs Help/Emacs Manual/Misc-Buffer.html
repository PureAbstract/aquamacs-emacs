   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dq-1283"></a><a name="index-buffer_002dread_002donly-1284"></a><a name="index-read_002donly-buffer-1285"></a>  A buffer can be <dfn>read-only</dfn>, which means that commands to change
its contents are not allowed.  The mode line indicates read-only
buffers with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%*</span></samp>&rsquo; near the left margin.  Read-only
buffers are usually made by subsystems such as Dired and Rmail that
have special commands to operate on the text; also by visiting a file
whose access control says you cannot write it.

   <p><a name="index-read_002donly_002dmode-1286"></a><a name="index-view_002dread_002donly-1287"></a> The command <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd> (<code>read-only-mode</code>) makes a read-only
buffer writable, and makes a writable buffer read-only.  This works by
setting the variable <code>buffer-read-only</code>, which has a local value
in each buffer and makes the buffer read-only if its value is
non-<code>nil</code>.  If you change the option <code>view-read-only</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, making the buffer read-only with <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd>
also enables View mode in the buffer (see <a href="View-Mode.html#View-Mode">View Mode</a>).

   <p><a name="index-rename_002dbuffer-1288"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-buffer</kbd> changes the name of the current buffer.  You
specify the new name as a minibuffer argument; there is no default. 
If you specify a name that is in use for some other buffer, an error
happens and no renaming is done.

   <p><a name="index-rename_002duniquely-1289"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-uniquely</kbd> renames the current buffer to a similar
name with a numeric suffix added to make it both different and unique. 
This command does not need an argument.  It is useful for creating
multiple shell buffers: if you rename the <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer, then
do <kbd>M-x shell</kbd> again, it makes a new shell buffer named
<samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp>; meanwhile, the old shell buffer continues to exist
under its new name.  This method is also good for mail buffers,
compilation buffers, and most Emacs features that create special
buffers with particular names.  (With some of these features, such as
<kbd>M-x compile</kbd>, <kbd>M-x grep</kbd>, you need to switch to some other
buffer before using the command again, otherwise it will reuse the
current buffer despite the name change.)

   <p>The commands <kbd>M-x append-to-buffer</kbd> and <kbd>M-x insert-buffer</kbd>
can also be used to copy text from one buffer to another.
