<h3 class="section">18.10 Diff Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Diff-mode-1143"></a><a name="index-diff_002dmode-1144"></a><a name="index-patches_002c-editing-1145"></a>
  Diff mode is a major mode used for the output of <kbd>M-x diff</kbd> and
other similar commands.  This kind of output is called a <dfn>patch</dfn>,
because it can be passed to the <samp><span class="command">patch</span></samp> command to
automatically apply the specified changes.  To select Diff mode
manually, type <kbd>M-x diff-mode</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-hunk_002c-diff-1146"></a>  The changes specified in a patch are grouped into <dfn>hunks</dfn>, which
are contiguous chunks of text that contain one or more changed lines. 
Hunks can also include unchanged lines to provide context for the
changes.  Each hunk is preceded by a <dfn>hunk header</dfn>, which
specifies the old and new line numbers at which the hunk occurs.  Diff
mode highlights each hunk header, to distinguish it from the actual
contents of the hunk.

   <p><a name="index-diff_002dupdate_002don_002dthe_002dfly-1147"></a>  You can edit a Diff mode buffer like any other buffer.  (If it is
read-only, you need to make it writable first.  See <a href="Misc-Buffer.html#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.) 
Whenever you change a hunk, Diff mode attempts to automatically
correct the line numbers in the hunk headers, to ensure that the patch
remains &ldquo;correct&rdquo;.  To disable automatic line number correction,
change the variable <code>diff-update-on-the-fly</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>Diff mode treats each hunk as an &ldquo;error message&rdquo;, similar to
Compilation mode.  Thus, you can use commands such as <kbd>C-x '</kbd> to
visit the corresponding source locations.  See <a href="Compilation-Mode.html#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>.

   <p>In addition, Diff mode provides the following commands to navigate,
manipulate and apply parts of patches:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-n</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dhunk_002dnext-1148"></a>Move to the next hunk-start (<code>diff-hunk-next</code>).

     <p><a name="index-diff_002dauto_002drefine_002dmode-1149"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Diff-Auto_002dRefine-1150"></a><a name="index-Diff-Auto_002dRefine-mode-1151"></a>This command has a side effect: it <dfn>refines</dfn> the hunk you move to,
highlighting its changes with better granularity.  To disable this
feature, type <kbd>M-x diff-auto-refine-mode</kbd> to toggle off the minor
mode Diff Auto-Refine mode.  To disable Diff Auto Refine mode by
default, add this to your init file (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>):

     <pre class="example">          (add-hook 'diff-mode-hook
                    (lambda () (diff-auto-refine-mode -1)))
</pre>
     <br><dt><kbd>M-p</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dhunk_002dprev-1152"></a>Move to the previous hunk-start (<code>diff-hunk-prev</code>).  Like
<kbd>M-n</kbd>, this has the side-effect of refining the hunk you move to,
unless you disable Diff Auto-Refine mode.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-}</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dfile_002dnext-1153"></a>Move to the next file-start, in a multi-file patch
(<code>diff-file-next</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-{</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dfile_002dprev-1154"></a>Move to the previous file-start, in a multi-file patch
(<code>diff-file-prev</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-k</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dhunk_002dkill-1155"></a>Kill the hunk at point (<code>diff-hunk-kill</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-K</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dfile_002dkill-1156"></a>In a multi-file patch, kill the current file part. 
(<code>diff-file-kill</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-a</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dapply_002dhunk-1157"></a>Apply this hunk to its target file (<code>diff-apply-hunk</code>).  With a
prefix argument of <kbd>C-u</kbd>, revert this hunk.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-b</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002drefine_002dhunk-1158"></a>Highlight the changes of the hunk at point with a finer granularity
(<code>diff-refine-hunk</code>).  This allows you to see exactly which parts
of each changed line were actually changed.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-c</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dgoto_002dsource-1159"></a>Go to the source file and line corresponding to this hunk
(<code>diff-goto-source</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-e</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dediff_002dpatch-1160"></a>Start an Ediff session with the patch (<code>diff-ediff-patch</code>). 
See <a href="../ediff/index.html#Top">Ediff</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002drestrict_002dview-1161"></a>Restrict the view to the current hunk (<code>diff-restrict-view</code>). 
See <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.  With a prefix argument of <kbd>C-u</kbd>, restrict the
view to the current file of a multiple-file patch.  To widen again,
use <kbd>C-x n w</kbd> (<code>widen</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dreverse_002ddirection-1162"></a>Reverse the direction of comparison for the entire buffer
(<code>diff-reverse-direction</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dsplit_002dhunk-1163"></a>Split the hunk at point (<code>diff-split-hunk</code>).  This is for
manually editing patches, and only works with the <dfn>unified diff
format</dfn> produced by the <samp><span class="option">-u</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--unified</span></samp> options to
the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> program.  If you need to split a hunk in the
<dfn>context diff format</dfn> produced by the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">--context</span></samp> options to <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>, first convert the buffer
to the unified diff format with <kbd>C-c C-u</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-d</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dunified_002d_003econtext-1164"></a>Convert the entire buffer to the <dfn>context diff format</dfn>
(<code>diff-unified-&gt;context</code>).  With a prefix argument, convert only
the text within the region.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-u</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dcontext_002d_003eunified-1165"></a>Convert the entire buffer to unified diff format
(<code>diff-context-&gt;unified</code>).  With a prefix argument, convert
unified format to context format.  When the mark is active, convert
only the text within the region.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-w</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002drefine_002dhunk-1166"></a>Refine the current hunk so that it disregards changes in whitespace
(<code>diff-refine-hunk</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x 4 A</kbd><dd><a name="index-diff_002dadd_002dchange_002dlog_002dentries_002dother_002dwindow-1167"></a><a name="index-add_002dchange_002dlog_002dentry_002dother_002dwindow_0040r_007b_002c-in-Diff-mode_007d-1168"></a>Generate a ChangeLog entry, like <kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> does (see <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>), for each one of the hunks
(<code>diff-add-change-log-entries-other-window</code>).  This creates a
skeleton of the log of changes that you can later fill with the actual
descriptions of the changes.  <kbd>C-x 4 a</kbd> itself in Diff mode
operates on behalf of the current hunk's file, but gets the function
name from the patch itself.  This is useful for making log entries for
functions that are deleted by the patch. 
</dl>

<!-- Trailing whitespace is NOT shown by default. -->
<!-- Emacs's dir-locals file enables this (for some reason). -->
   <p><a name="index-trailing-whitespace_002c-in-patches-1169"></a><a name="index-diff_002ddelete_002dtrailing_002dwhitespace-1170"></a>  Patches sometimes include trailing whitespace on modified lines, as
an unintentional and undesired change.  There are two ways to deal
with this problem.  Firstly, if you enable Whitespace mode in a Diff
buffer (see <a href="Useless-Whitespace.html#Useless-Whitespace">Useless Whitespace</a>), it automatically highlights
trailing whitespace in modified lines.  Secondly, you can use the
command <kbd>M-x diff-delete-trailing-whitespace</kbd>, which searches for
trailing whitespace in the lines modified by the patch, and removes
that whitespace in both the patch and the patched source file(s). 
This command does not save the modifications that it makes, so you can
decide whether to save the changes (the list of modified files is
displayed in the echo area).  With a prefix argument, it tries to
modify the original source files rather than the patched source files.
