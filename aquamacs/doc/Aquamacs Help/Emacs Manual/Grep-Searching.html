<h3 class="section">27.4 Searching with Grep under Emacs</h3>

<p>Just as you can run a compiler from Emacs and then visit the lines
with compilation errors, you can also run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> and then
visit the lines on which matches were found.  This works by treating
the matches reported by <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> as if they were &ldquo;errors&rdquo;. 
The output buffer uses Grep mode, which is a variant of Compilation
mode (see <a href="Compilation-Mode.html#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x grep</kbd><dt><kbd>M-x lgrep</kbd><dd>Run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> asynchronously under Emacs, listing matching lines in
the buffer named <samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x grep-find</kbd><dt><kbd>M-x find-grep</kbd><dt><kbd>M-x rgrep</kbd><dd>Run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> via <code>find</code>, and collect output in the
<samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x zrgrep</kbd><dd>Run <code>zgrep</code> and collect output in the <samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> buffer. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-grep</kbd><dd>Kill the running <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> subprocess. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-grep-2574"></a>  To run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>, type <kbd>M-x grep</kbd>, then enter a command line
that specifies how to run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>.  Use the same arguments you
would give <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> when running it normally: a <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>-style
regexp (usually in single-quotes to quote the shell's special
characters) followed by file names, which may use wildcards.  If you
specify a prefix argument for <kbd>M-x grep</kbd>, it finds the tag
(see <a href="Tags.html#Tags">Tags</a>) in the buffer around point, and puts that into the
default <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> command.

   <p>Your command need not simply run <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>; you can use any shell
command that produces output in the same format.  For instance, you
can chain <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> commands, like this:

<pre class="example">     grep -nH -e foo *.el | grep bar | grep toto
</pre>
   <p>The output from <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> goes in the <samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> buffer.  You
can find the corresponding lines in the original files using <kbd>C-x&nbsp;`</kbd><!-- /@w -->, &lt;RET&gt;, and so forth, just like compilation errors.

   <p>Some grep programs accept a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--color</span></samp>&rsquo; option to output special
markers around matches for the purpose of highlighting.  You can make
use of this feature by setting <code>grep-highlight-matches</code> to
<code>t</code>.  When displaying a match in the source buffer, the exact
match will be highlighted, instead of the entire source line.

   <p><a name="index-grep_002dfind-2575"></a><a name="index-find_002dgrep-2576"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x grep-find</kbd> (also available as <kbd>M-x
find-grep</kbd>) is similar to <kbd>M-x grep</kbd>, but it supplies a different
initial default for the command&mdash;one that runs both <code>find</code> and
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>, so as to search every file in a directory tree.  See also
the <code>find-grep-dired</code> command, in <a href="Dired-and-Find.html#Dired-and-Find">Dired and Find</a>.

   <p><a name="index-lgrep-2577"></a><a name="index-rgrep-2578"></a><a name="index-zrgrep-2579"></a>  The commands <kbd>M-x lgrep</kbd> (local grep) and <kbd>M-x rgrep</kbd>
(recursive grep) are more user-friendly versions of <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> and
<code>grep-find</code>, which prompt separately for the regular expression
to match, the files to search, and the base directory for the search. 
Case sensitivity of the search is controlled by the current value of
<code>case-fold-search</code>.  The command <kbd>M-x zrgrep</kbd> is similar to
<kbd>M-x rgrep</kbd>, but it calls <samp><span class="command">zgrep</span></samp> instead of
<samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp> to search the contents of gzipped files.

   <p>These commands build the shell commands based on the variables
<code>grep-template</code> (for <code>lgrep</code>) and <code>grep-find-template</code>
(for <code>rgrep</code>).  The files to search can use aliases defined in
the variable <code>grep-files-aliases</code>.

   <p><a name="index-grep_002dfind_002dignored_002ddirectories-2580"></a>  Directories listed in the variable
<code>grep-find-ignored-directories</code> are automatically skipped by
<kbd>M-x rgrep</kbd>.  The default value includes the data directories used
by various version control systems.
