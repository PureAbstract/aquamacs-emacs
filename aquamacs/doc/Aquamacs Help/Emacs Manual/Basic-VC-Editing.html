<h4 class="subsection">28.1.3 Basic Editing under Version Control</h4>

<p><a name="index-filesets_002c-VC-2770"></a><a name="index-VC-filesets-2771"></a>   Most VC commands operate on <dfn>VC filesets</dfn>.  A VC fileset is a
collection of one or more files that a VC operation acts on.  When you
type VC commands in a buffer visiting a version-controlled file, the
VC fileset is simply that one file.  When you type them in a VC
Directory buffer, and some files in it are marked, the VC fileset
consists of the marked files (see <a href="VC-Directory-Mode.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>).

   <p>On modern changeset-based version control systems (see <a href="VCS-Changesets.html#VCS-Changesets">VCS Changesets</a>), VC commands handle multi-file VC filesets as a group. 
For example, committing a multi-file VC fileset generates a single
revision, containing the changes to all those files.  On older
file-based version control systems like CVS, each file in a multi-file
VC fileset is handled individually; for example, a commit generates
one revision for each changed file.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v v</kbd><dd>Perform the next appropriate version control operation on the current
VC fileset. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dnext_002daction-2772"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-v-2773"></a>  The principal VC command is a multi-purpose command, <kbd>C-x v v</kbd>
(<code>vc-next-action</code>), which performs the &ldquo;most appropriate&rdquo;
action on the current VC fileset: either registering it with a version
control system, or committing it, or unlocking it, or merging changes
into it.  The precise actions are described in detail in the following
subsections.  You can use <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> either in a file-visiting
buffer or in a VC Directory buffer.

   <p>Note that VC filesets are distinct from the &ldquo;named filesets&rdquo; used
for viewing and visiting files in functional groups
(see <a href="Filesets.html#Filesets">Filesets</a>).  Unlike named filesets, VC filesets are not named
and don't persist across sessions.
