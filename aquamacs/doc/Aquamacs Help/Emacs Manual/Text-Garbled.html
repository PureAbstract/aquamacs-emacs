<h3 class="section">50.4 Garbage in the Text</h3>

<p>If <kbd>C-l</kbd> shows that the text is wrong, first type <kbd>C-h l</kbd> to
see what commands you typed to produce the observed results.  Then try
undoing the changes step by step using <kbd>C-x u</kbd>, until it gets back
to a state you consider correct.

   <p>If a large portion of text appears to be missing at the beginning or
end of the buffer, check for the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Narrow</span></samp>&rsquo; in the mode line. 
If it appears, the text you don't see is probably still present, but
temporarily off-limits.  To make it accessible again, type <kbd>C-x n
w</kbd>.  See <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>.
