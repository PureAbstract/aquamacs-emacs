<h3 class="section">G.5 HOME and Startup Directories on MS-Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bHOME_007d-directory-on-MS_002dWindows-4405"></a>
  The Windows equivalent of the <code>HOME</code> directory is the
<dfn>user-specific application data directory</dfn>.  The actual location
depends on your Windows version and system configuration; typical values
are <samp><span class="file">C:\Documents and Settings\</span><var>username</var><span class="file">\Application Data</span></samp> on
Windows 2K/XP and later, and either <samp><span class="file">C:\WINDOWS\Application Data</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="file">C:\WINDOWS\Profiles\</span><var>username</var><span class="file">\Application Data</span></samp> on the
older Windows 9X/ME systems.

   <p><code>HOME</code> can also be set in the system registry, for details see
<a href="MS_002dWindows-Registry.html#MS_002dWindows-Registry">MS-Windows Registry</a>.

   <p><a name="index-init-file-_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-on-MS_002dWindows-4406"></a>  The home directory is where your init file <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> is stored. 
When Emacs starts, it first checks whether the environment variable
<samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> is set.  If it is, it looks for the init file in the
directory pointed by <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>.  If <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> is not defined, Emacs
checks for an existing <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file in <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp>, the root
directory of drive <samp><span class="file">C:</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  If there's no such file in <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp>, Emacs next uses the Windows
system calls to find out the exact location of your application data
directory.  If that system call fails, Emacs falls back to <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp>.

   <p>Whatever the final place is, Emacs sets the value of the <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>
environment variable to point to it, and it will use that location for
other files and directories it normally creates in the user's home
directory.

   <p>You can always find out where Emacs thinks is your home directory's
location by typing <kbd>C-x d ~/ &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  This should present the
list of files in the home directory, and show its full name on the
first line.  Likewise, to visit your init file, type <kbd>C-x C-f
~/.emacs &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_005femacs_007d-init-file_002c-MS_002dWindows-4407"></a>  Because MS-DOS does not allow file names with leading dots, and
because older Windows systems made it hard to create files with such
names, the Windows port of Emacs supports an alternative name
<samp><span class="file">_emacs</span></samp> as a fallback, if such a file exists in the home
directory, whereas <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> does not.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> 
The check in <samp><span class="file">C:\</span></samp> is for compatibility with older versions of Emacs,
which didn't check the application data directory.
