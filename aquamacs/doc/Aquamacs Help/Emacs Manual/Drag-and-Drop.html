<p><a name="index-drag-and-drop-1510"></a>
  In most graphical desktop environments, Emacs has basic support for
<dfn>drag and drop</dfn> operations.  For instance, dropping text onto an
Emacs frame inserts the text where it is dropped.  Dropping a file
onto an Emacs frame visits that file.  As a special case, dropping the
file on a Dired buffer moves or copies the file (according to the
conventions of the application it came from) into the directory
displayed in that buffer.

   <p><a name="index-dnd_002dopen_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow-1511"></a>  Dropping a file normally visits it in the window you drop it on.  If
you prefer to visit the file in a new window in such cases, customize
the variable <code>dnd-open-file-other-window</code>.

   <p>The XDND and Motif drag and drop protocols, and the old KDE 1.x
protocol, are currently supported.
