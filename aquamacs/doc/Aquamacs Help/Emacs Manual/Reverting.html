<h3 class="section">18.4 Reverting a Buffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-revert_002dbuffer-1085"></a><a name="index-drastic-changes-1086"></a><a name="index-reread-a-file-1087"></a>
  If you have made extensive changes to a file-visiting buffer and
then change your mind, you can <dfn>revert</dfn> the changes and go back to
the saved version of the file.  To do this, type <kbd>M-x
revert-buffer</kbd>.  Since reverting unintentionally could lose a lot of
work, Emacs asks for confirmation first.

   <p>The <code>revert-buffer</code> command tries to position point in such a
way that, if the file was edited only slightly, you will be at
approximately the same part of the text as before.  But if you have
made major changes, point may end up in a totally different location.

   <p>Reverting marks the buffer as &ldquo;not modified&rdquo;.  It also clears the
buffer's undo history (see <a href="Undo.html#Undo">Undo</a>).  Thus, the reversion cannot be
undone&mdash;if you change your mind yet again, you can't use the undo
commands to bring the reverted changes back.

   <p>Some kinds of buffers that are not associated with files, such as
Dired buffers, can also be reverted.  For them, reverting means
recalculating their contents.  Buffers created explicitly with
<kbd>C-x b</kbd> cannot be reverted; <code>revert-buffer</code> reports an error
if you try.

   <p><a name="index-revert_002dwithout_002dquery-1088"></a>  When you edit a file that changes automatically and frequently&mdash;for
example, a log of output from a process that continues to run&mdash;it may
be useful for Emacs to revert the file without querying you.  To
request this behavior, set the variable <code>revert-without-query</code> to
a list of regular expressions.  When a file name matches one of these
regular expressions, <code>find-file</code> and <code>revert-buffer</code> will
revert it automatically if it has changed&mdash;provided the buffer itself
is not modified.  (If you have edited the text, it would be wrong to
discard your changes.)

   <p><a name="index-Global-Auto_002dRevert-mode-1089"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Global-Auto_002dRevert-1090"></a><a name="index-Auto_002dRevert-mode-1091"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Auto_002dRevert-1092"></a><a name="index-global_002dauto_002drevert_002dmode-1093"></a><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dmode-1094"></a><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dtail_002dmode-1095"></a><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dinterval-1096"></a>  You can also tell Emacs to revert buffers periodically.  To do this
for a specific buffer, enable the minor mode Auto-Revert mode by
typing <kbd>M-x auto-revert-mode</kbd>.  This automatically reverts the
current buffer every five seconds; you can change the interval through
the variable <code>auto-revert-interval</code>.  To do the same for all file
buffers, type <kbd>M-x global-auto-revert-mode</kbd> to enable Global
Auto-Revert mode.  These minor modes do not check or revert remote
files, because that is usually too slow.

   <p>One use of Auto-Revert mode is to &ldquo;tail&rdquo; a file such as a system
log, so that changes made to that file by other programs are
continuously displayed.  To do this, just move the point to the end of
the buffer, and it will stay there as the file contents change. 
However, if you are sure that the file will only change by growing at
the end, use Auto-Revert Tail mode instead
(<code>auto-revert-tail-mode</code>).  It is more efficient for this. 
Auto-Revert Tail mode works also for remote files.

   <p>See <a href="VC-Undo.html#VC-Undo">VC Undo</a>, for commands to revert to earlier versions of files
under version control.  See <a href="VC-Mode-Line.html#VC-Mode-Line">VC Mode Line</a>, for Auto Revert
peculiarities when visiting files under version control.
