<h3 class="section">25.2 Sentences</h3>

<p><a name="index-sentences-1796"></a><a name="index-manipulating-sentences-1797"></a>
  The Emacs commands for manipulating sentences and paragraphs are
mostly on Meta keys, like the word-handling commands.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-a</kbd><dd>Move back to the beginning of the sentence (<code>backward-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-e</kbd><dd>Move forward to the end of the sentence (<code>forward-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-k</kbd><dd>Kill forward to the end of the sentence (<code>kill-sentence</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Kill back to the beginning of the sentence (<code>backward-kill-sentence</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002da-1798"></a><a name="index-M_002de-1799"></a><a name="index-backward_002dsentence-1800"></a><a name="index-forward_002dsentence-1801"></a>  The commands <kbd>M-a</kbd> (<code>backward-sentence</code>) and <kbd>M-e</kbd>
(<code>forward-sentence</code>) move to the beginning and end of the current
sentence, respectively.  Their bindings were chosen to resemble
<kbd>C-a</kbd> and <kbd>C-e</kbd>, which move to the beginning and end of a
line.  Unlike them, <kbd>M-a</kbd> and <kbd>M-e</kbd> move over successive
sentences if repeated.

   <p>Moving backward over a sentence places point just before the first
character of the sentence; moving forward places point right after the
punctuation that ends the sentence.  Neither one moves over the
whitespace at the sentence boundary.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dk-1802"></a><a name="index-kill_002dsentence-1803"></a>  Just as <kbd>C-a</kbd> and <kbd>C-e</kbd> have a kill command, <kbd>C-k</kbd>, to
go with them, <kbd>M-a</kbd> and <kbd>M-e</kbd> have a corresponding kill
command: <kbd>M-k</kbd> (<code>kill-sentence</code>) kills from point to the end
of the sentence.  With a positive numeric argument <var>n</var>, it kills
the next <var>n</var> sentences; with a negative argument &minus;<var>n</var>,
it kills back to the beginning of the <var>n</var>th preceding sentence.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-DEL-1804"></a><a name="index-backward_002dkill_002dsentence-1805"></a>  The <kbd>C-x &lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> (<code>backward-kill-sentence</code>) kills back
to the beginning of a sentence.

   <p>The sentence commands assume that you follow the American typist's
convention of putting two spaces at the end of a sentence.  That is, a
sentence ends wherever there is a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;
followed by the end of a line or two spaces, with any number of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; characters allowed in
between.  A sentence also begins or ends wherever a paragraph begins
or ends.  It is useful to follow this convention, because it allows
the Emacs sentence commands to distinguish between periods that end a
sentence and periods that indicate abbreviations.

   <p><a name="index-sentence_002dend_002ddouble_002dspace-1806"></a>  If you want to use just one space between sentences, you can set the
variable <code>sentence-end-double-space</code> to <code>nil</code> to make the
sentence commands stop for single spaces.  However, this has a
drawback: there is no way to distinguish between periods that end
sentences and those that indicate abbreviations.  For convenient and
reliable editing, we therefore recommend you follow the two-space
convention.  The variable <code>sentence-end-double-space</code> also
affects filling (see <a href="Fill-Commands.html#Fill-Commands">Fill Commands</a>).

   <p><a name="index-sentence_002dend-1807"></a>  The variable <code>sentence-end</code> controls how to recognize the end
of a sentence.  If non-<code>nil</code>, its value should be a regular
expression, which is used to match the last few characters of a
sentence, together with the whitespace following the sentence
(see <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  If the value is <code>nil</code>, the default, then
Emacs computes sentence ends according to various criteria such as the
value of <code>sentence-end-double-space</code>.

   <p><a name="index-sentence_002dend_002dwithout_002dperiod-1808"></a>  Some languages, such as Thai, do not use periods to indicate the end
of a sentence.  Set the variable <code>sentence-end-without-period</code> to
<code>t</code> in such cases.
