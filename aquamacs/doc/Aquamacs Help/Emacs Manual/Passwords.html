<h3 class="section">8.6 Entering passwords</h3>

<p>Sometimes, you may need to enter a password into Emacs.  For instance,
when you tell Emacs to visit a file on another machine via a network
protocol such as FTP, you often need to supply a password to gain
access to the machine (see <a href="Remote-Files.html#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>).

   <p>Entering a password is, in a basic sense, similar to using a
minibuffer.  Emacs displays a prompt in the echo area (such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Password: </span></samp>&rsquo;); after you type the required password, press
&lt;RET&gt; to submit it.  To prevent others from seeing your password,
every character you type is displayed as a dot (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;) instead of
its usual form.

   <p>Most of the features and commands associated with the minibuffer can
<em>not</em> be used when entering a password.  There is no history or
completion, and you cannot change windows or perform any other action
with Emacs until you have submitted the password.

   <p>While you are typing the password, you may press &lt;DEL&gt; to delete
backwards, removing the last character entered.  &lt;C-u&gt; deletes
everything you have typed so far.  <kbd>C-g</kbd> quits the password prompt
(see <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>).  <kbd>C-y</kbd> inserts the current kill into the
password (see <a href="Killing.html#Killing">Killing</a>).  You may type either &lt;RET&gt; or
&lt;ESC&gt; to submit the password.  Any other self-inserting character
key inserts the associated character into the password, and all other
input is ignored.
