<h4 class="subsection">12.3.2 Cut and Paste with Other Window Applications</h4>

<p><a name="index-X-cutting-and-pasting-454"></a><a name="index-X-selection-455"></a><a name="index-primary-selection-456"></a><a name="index-selection_002c-primary-457"></a>
  Under the X Window System, there exists a <dfn>primary selection</dfn>
containing the last stretch of text selected in an X application
(usually by dragging the mouse).  Typically, this text can be inserted
into other X applications by <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> clicks.  The primary
selection is separate from the clipboard.  Its contents are more
&ldquo;fragile&rdquo;; they are overwritten each time you select text with the
mouse, whereas the clipboard is only overwritten by explicit &ldquo;cut&rdquo;
or &ldquo;copy&rdquo; commands.

   <p>Under X, whenever the region is active (see <a href="Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>), the text in
the region is saved in the primary selection.  This applies regardless
of whether the region was made by dragging or clicking the mouse
(see <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>), or by keyboard commands (e.g., by typing
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> and moving point; see <a href="Setting-Mark.html#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).

   <p><a name="index-select_002dactive_002dregions-458"></a>  If you change the variable <code>select-active-regions</code> to
<code>only</code>, Emacs saves only temporarily active regions to the
primary selection, i.e., those made with the mouse or with shift
selection (see <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>).  If you change
<code>select-active-regions</code> to <code>nil</code>, Emacs avoids saving active
regions to the primary selection entirely.

   <p>To insert the primary selection into an Emacs buffer, click
<kbd>mouse-2</kbd> (<code>mouse-yank-primary</code>) where you want to insert it. 
See <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>.

   <p><a name="index-MS_002dWindows_002c-and-primary-selection-459"></a>  MS-Windows provides no primary selection, but Emacs emulates it
within a single Emacs session by storing the selected text internally. 
Therefore, all the features and commands related to the primary
selection work on Windows as they do on X, for cutting and pasting
within the same session, but not across Emacs sessions or with other
applications.
