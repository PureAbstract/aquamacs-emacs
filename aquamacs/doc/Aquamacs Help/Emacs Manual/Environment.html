<h3 class="appendixsec">C.4 Environment Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-environment-variables-4585"></a>
  The <dfn>environment</dfn> is a feature of the operating system; it
consists of a collection of variables with names and values.  Each
variable is called an <dfn>environment variable</dfn>; environment variable
names are case-sensitive, and it is conventional to use upper case
letters only.  The values are all text strings.

   <p>What makes the environment useful is that subprocesses inherit the
environment automatically from their parent process.  This means you
can set up an environment variable in your login shell, and all the
programs you run (including Emacs) will automatically see it. 
Subprocesses of Emacs (such as shells, compilers, and version control
programs) inherit the environment from Emacs, too.

   <p><a name="index-setenv-4586"></a><a name="index-getenv-4587"></a><a name="index-initial_002denvironment-4588"></a>  Inside Emacs, the command <kbd>M-x getenv</kbd> reads the name of an
environment variable, and prints its value in the echo area.  <kbd>M-x
setenv</kbd> sets a variable in the Emacs environment, and <kbd>C-u M-x
setenv</kbd> removes a variable.  (Environment variable substitutions with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; work in the value just as in file names; see <a href="File-Names-with-_0024.html#File-Names-with-_0024">File Names with $</a>.)  The variable <code>initial-environment</code> stores the initial
environment inherited by Emacs.

   <p>The way to set environment variables outside of Emacs depends on the
operating system, and especially the shell that you are using.  For
example, here's how to set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">ORGANIZATION</span></samp>
to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">not very much</span></samp>&rsquo; using Bash:

<pre class="example">     export ORGANIZATION="not very much"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and here's how to do it in csh or tcsh:

<pre class="example">     setenv ORGANIZATION "not very much"
</pre>
   <p>When Emacs is using the X Window System, various environment
variables that control X work for Emacs as well.  See the X
documentation for more information.
