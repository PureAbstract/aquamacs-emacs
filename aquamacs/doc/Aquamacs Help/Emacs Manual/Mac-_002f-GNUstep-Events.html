<h3 class="section">F.3 Windowing System Events under Mac OS / GNUstep</h3>

<p>Nextstep applications receive a number of special events which have
no X equivalent.  These are sent as specially defined &ldquo;keys&rdquo;, which
do not correspond to any sequence of keystrokes.  Under Emacs, these
&ldquo;key&rdquo; events can be bound to functions just like ordinary
keystrokes.  Here is a list of these events.

     <dl>
<dt>&lt;ns-open-file&gt;<dd><a name="index-ns_002dpop_002dup_002dframes-4708"></a>This event occurs when another Nextstep application requests that
Emacs open a file.  A typical reason for this would be a user
double-clicking a file in the Finder application.  By default, Emacs
responds to this event by opening a new frame and visiting the file in
that frame (<code>ns-find-file</code>).  As an exception, if the selected
buffer is the <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp> buffer, Emacs visits the file in the
selected frame.

     <p>You can change how Emacs responds to a <code>ns-open-file</code> event by
changing the variable <code>ns-pop-up-frames</code>.  Its default value,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fresh</span></samp>&rsquo;, is what we have just described.  A value of <code>t</code>
means to always visit the file in a new frame.  A value of <code>nil</code>
means to always visit the file in an existing frame.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-open-temp-file&gt;<dd>This event occurs when another application requests that Emacs open a
temporary file.  By default, this is handled by just generating a
<code>ns-open-file</code> event, the results of which are described above.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-open-file-line&gt;<dd>Some applications, such as ProjectBuilder and gdb, request not only a
particular file, but also a particular line or sequence of lines in
the file.  Emacs handles this by visiting that file and highlighting
the requested line (<code>ns-open-file-select-line</code>).

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-drag-file&gt;<dd>This event occurs when a user drags files from another application
into an Emacs frame.  The default behavior is to insert the contents
of all the dragged files into the current buffer
(<code>ns-insert-files</code>).  The list of dragged files is stored in the
variable <code>ns-input-file</code>.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-drag-color&gt;<dd>This event occurs when a user drags a color from the color well (or
some other source) into an Emacs frame.  The default behavior is to
alter the foreground color of the area the color was dragged onto
(<code>ns-set-foreground-at-mouse</code>).  If this event is issued with a
&lt;Shift&gt; modifier, Emacs changes the background color instead
(<code>ns-set-background-at-mouse</code>).  The name of the dragged color is
stored in the variable <code>ns-input-color</code>.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-change-font&gt;<dd>This event occurs when the user selects a font in a Nextstep font
panel (which can be opened with <kbd>Cmd-t</kbd>).  The default behavior is
to adjust the font of the selected frame
(<code>ns-respond-to-changefont</code>).  The name and size of the selected
font are stored in the variables <code>ns-input-font</code> and
<code>ns-input-fontsize</code>, respectively.

     <br><dt>&lt;ns-power-off&gt;<dd>This event occurs when the user logs out and Emacs is still running, or when
`Quit Emacs' is chosen from the application menu. 
The default behavior is to save all file-visiting buffers. 
</dl>

   <p>Emacs also allows users to make use of Nextstep services, via a set
of commands whose names begin with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ns-service-</span></samp>&rsquo; and end with the
name of the service.  Type <kbd>M-x ns-service-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to
see a list of these commands.  These functions either operate on
marked text (replacing it with the result) or take a string argument
and return the result as a string.  You can also use the Lisp function
<code>ns-perform-service</code> to pass arbitrary strings to arbitrary
services and receive the results back.  Note that you may need to
restart Emacs to access newly-available services.
