<h4 class="subsection">28.1.6 Examining And Comparing Old Revisions</h4>

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v =</kbd><dd>Compare the work files in the current VC fileset with the versions you
started from (<code>vc-diff</code>).  With a prefix argument, prompt for two
revisions of the current VC fileset and compare them.  You can also
call this command from a Dired buffer (see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x vc-ediff</kbd><dd>Like <kbd>C-x v =</kbd>, but using Ediff.  See <a href="../ediff/index.html#Top">Ediff</a>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v D</kbd><dd>Compare the entire working tree to the revision you started from
(<code>vc-root-diff</code>).  With a prefix argument, prompt for two
revisions and compare their trees.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v ~</kbd><dd>Prompt for a revision of the current file, and visit it in a separate
buffer (<code>vc-revision-other-window</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v g</kbd><dd>Display an annotated version of the current file: for each line, show
the latest revision in which it was modified (<code>vc-annotate</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddiff-2793"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-_003d-2794"></a>  <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> (<code>vc-diff</code>) displays a <dfn>diff</dfn> which compares
each work file in the current VC fileset to the version(s) from which
you started editing.  The diff is displayed in another window, in a
Diff mode buffer (see <a href="Diff-Mode.html#Diff-Mode">Diff Mode</a>) named <samp><span class="file">*vc-diff*</span></samp>.  The
usual Diff mode commands are available in this buffer.  In particular,
the <kbd>g</kbd> (<code>revert-buffer</code>) command performs the file
comparison again, generating a new diff.

   <p><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dx-v-_003d-2795"></a>  To compare two arbitrary revisions of the current VC fileset, call
<code>vc-diff</code> with a prefix argument: <kbd>C-u C-x v =</kbd>.  This
prompts for two revision IDs (see <a href="VCS-Concepts.html#VCS-Concepts">VCS Concepts</a>), and displays a
diff between those versions of the fileset.  This will not work
reliably for multi-file VC filesets, if the version control system is
file-based rather than changeset-based (e.g., CVS), since then
revision IDs for different files would not be related in any
meaningful way.

   <p>Instead of the revision ID, some version control systems let you
specify revisions in other formats.  For instance, under Bazaar you
can enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">date:yesterday</span></samp>&rsquo; for the argument to <kbd>C-u C-x v =</kbd>
(and related commands) to specify the first revision committed after
yesterday.  See the documentation of the version control system for
details.

   <p>If you invoke <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> or <kbd>C-u C-x v =</kbd> from a Dired buffer
(see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>), the file listed on the current line is treated as the
current VC fileset.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dediff-2796"></a>  <kbd>M-x vc-ediff</kbd> works like <kbd>C-x v =</kbd>, except that it uses an
Ediff session.  See <a href="../ediff/index.html#Top">Ediff</a>.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002droot_002ddiff-2797"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-D-2798"></a>  <kbd>C-x v D</kbd> (<code>vc-root-diff</code>) is similar to <kbd>C-x v =</kbd>, but
it displays the changes in the entire current working tree (i.e., the
working tree containing the current VC fileset).  If you invoke this
command from a Dired buffer, it applies to the working tree containing
the directory.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddiff_002dswitches-2799"></a>  You can customize the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> options that <kbd>C-x v =</kbd> and
<kbd>C-x v D</kbd> use for generating diffs.  The options used are taken
from the first non-<code>nil</code> value amongst the variables
<code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-diff-switches</code>, <code>vc-diff-switches</code>, and
<code>diff-switches</code> (see <a href="Comparing-Files.html#Comparing-Files">Comparing Files</a>), in that order.  Here,
<var>backend</var> stands for the relevant version control system,
e.g., <code>bzr</code> for Bazaar.  Since <code>nil</code> means to check the
next variable in the sequence, either of the first two may use the
value <code>t</code> to mean no switches at all.  Most of the
<code>vc-</code><var>backend</var><code>-diff-switches</code> variables default to <code>nil</code>,
but some default to <code>t</code>; these are for version control systems
whose <code>diff</code> implementations do not accept common diff options,
such as Subversion.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002drevision_002dother_002dwindow-2800"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-_007e-2801"></a>  To directly examine an older version of a file, visit the work file
and type <kbd>C-x v ~ </kbd><var>revision</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
(<code>vc-revision-other-window</code>).  This retrieves the file version
corresponding to <var>revision</var>, saves it to
<samp><var>filename</var><span class="file">.~</span><var>revision</var><span class="file">~</span></samp>, and visits it in a separate
window.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dannotate-2802"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-v-g-2803"></a>  Many version control systems allow you to view files <dfn>annotated</dfn>
with per-line revision information, by typing <kbd>C-x v g</kbd>
(<code>vc-annotate</code>).  This creates a new buffer (the &ldquo;annotate
buffer&rdquo;) displaying the file's text, with each line colored to show
how old it is.  Red text is new, blue is old, and intermediate colors
indicate intermediate ages.  By default, the color is scaled over the
full range of ages, such that the oldest changes are blue, and the
newest changes are red.

   <p>When you give a prefix argument to this command, Emacs reads two
arguments using the minibuffer: the revision to display and annotate
(instead of the current file contents), and the time span in days the
color range should cover.

   <p>From the annotate buffer, these and other color scaling options are
available from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">VC-Annotate</span></samp>&rsquo; menu.  In this buffer, you can
also use the following keys to browse the annotations of past revisions,
view diffs, or view log entries:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Annotate the previous revision, i.e., the revision before the one
currently annotated.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat count, so
<kbd>C-u 10 p</kbd> would take you back 10 revisions.

     <br><dt><kbd>n</kbd><dd>Annotate the next revision, i.e., the revision after the one
currently annotated.  A numeric prefix argument is a repeat count.

     <br><dt><kbd>j</kbd><dd>Annotate the revision indicated by the current line.

     <br><dt><kbd>a</kbd><dd>Annotate the revision before the one indicated by the current line. 
This is useful to see the state the file was in before the change on
the current line was made.

     <br><dt><kbd>f</kbd><dd>Show in a buffer the file revision indicated by the current line.

     <br><dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Display the diff between the current line's revision and the previous
revision.  This is useful to see what the current line's revision
actually changed in the file.

     <br><dt><kbd>D</kbd><dd>Display the diff between the current line's revision and the previous
revision for all files in the changeset (for VC systems that support
changesets).  This is useful to see what the current line's revision
actually changed in the tree.

     <br><dt><kbd>l</kbd><dd>Show the log of the current line's revision.  This is useful to see
the author's description of the changes in the revision on the current
line.

     <br><dt><kbd>w</kbd><dd>Annotate the working revision&ndash;the one you are editing.  If you used
<kbd>p</kbd> and <kbd>n</kbd> to browse to other revisions, use this key to
return to your working revision.

     <br><dt><kbd>v</kbd><dd>Toggle the annotation visibility.  This is useful for looking just at
the file contents without distraction from the annotations.
