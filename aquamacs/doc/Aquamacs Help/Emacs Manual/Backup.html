<h4 class="subsection">18.3.2 Backup Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-backup-file-1050"></a><a name="index-make_002dbackup_002dfiles-1051"></a><a name="index-vc_002dmake_002dbackup_002dfiles-1052"></a>
  On most operating systems, rewriting a file automatically destroys all
record of what the file used to contain.  Thus, saving a file from Emacs
throws away the old contents of the file&mdash;or it would, except that
Emacs carefully copies the old contents to another file, called the
<dfn>backup</dfn> file, before actually saving.

   <p>Emacs makes a backup for a file only the first time the file is
saved from a buffer.  No matter how many times you subsequently save
the file, its backup remains unchanged.  However, if you kill the
buffer and then visit the file again, a new backup file will be made.

   <p>For most files, the variable <code>make-backup-files</code> determines
whether to make backup files.  On most operating systems, its default
value is <code>t</code>, so that Emacs does write backup files.

   <p>For files managed by a version control system (see <a href="Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), the variable <code>vc-make-backup-files</code> determines whether
to make backup files.  By default it is <code>nil</code>, since backup files
are redundant when you store all the previous versions in a version
control system. 
See <a href="General-VC-Options.html#General-VC-Options">General VC Options</a>.

   <p>At your option, Emacs can keep either a single backup for each file,
or make a series of numbered backup files for each file that you edit. 
See <a href="Backup-Names.html#Backup-Names">Backup Names</a>.

   <p><a name="index-backup_002denable_002dpredicate-1053"></a><a name="index-temporary_002dfile_002ddirectory-1054"></a><a name="index-small_002dtemporary_002dfile_002ddirectory-1055"></a>  The default value of the <code>backup-enable-predicate</code> variable
prevents backup files being written for files in the directories used
for temporary files, specified by <code>temporary-file-directory</code> or
<code>small-temporary-file-directory</code>.

   <p>You can explicitly tell Emacs to make another backup file from a
buffer, even though that buffer has been saved before.  If you save
the buffer with <kbd>C-u C-x C-s</kbd>, the version thus saved will be made
into a backup file if you save the buffer again.  <kbd>C-u C-u C-x
C-s</kbd> saves the buffer, but first makes the previous file contents into
a new backup file.  <kbd>C-u C-u C-u C-x C-s</kbd> does both things: it
makes a backup from the previous contents, and arranges to make
another from the newly saved contents if you save again.
