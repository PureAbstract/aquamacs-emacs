<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.10.1 The VC Directory Buffer</h5>

<p>The VC Directory buffer contains a list of version-controlled files
and their version control statuses.  It lists files in the current
directory (the one specified when you called <kbd>C-x v d</kbd>) and its
subdirectories, but only those with a &ldquo;noteworthy&rdquo; status.  Files
that are up-to-date (i.e., the same as in the repository) are
omitted.  If all the files in a subdirectory are up-to-date, the
subdirectory is not listed either.  As an exception, if a file has
become up-to-date as a direct result of a VC command, it is listed.

   <p>Here is an example of a VC Directory buffer listing:

<pre class="smallexample">                          ./
         edited           configure.ac
     *   added            README
         unregistered     temp.txt
                          src/
     *   edited           src/main.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Two work files have been modified but not committed:
<samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> in the current directory, and <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> in the
<samp><span class="file">src/</span></samp> subdirectory.  The file named <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> has been added
but is not yet committed, while <samp><span class="file">temp.txt</span></samp> is not under version
control (see <a href="Registering.html#Registering">Registering</a>).

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; characters next to the entries for <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">src/main.c</span></samp> indicate that the user has marked out these files as
the current VC fileset
(see <a href="VC-Directory-Commands.html#VC-Directory-Commands">VC Directory Commands</a>).

   <p>The above example is typical for a decentralized version control
system like Bazaar, Git, or Mercurial.  Other systems can show other
statuses.  For instance, CVS shows the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">needs-update</span></samp>&rsquo; status if
the repository has changes that have not been applied to the work
file.  RCS and SCCS show the name of the user locking a file as its
status.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dstay_002dlocal-2820"></a><a name="index-vc_002dcvs_002dstay_002dlocal-2821"></a>  On CVS and Subversion, the <code>vc-dir</code> command normally contacts
the repository, which may be on a remote machine, to check for
updates.  If you change the variable <code>vc-stay-local</code> or
<code>vc-cvs-stay-local</code> (for CVS) to <code>nil</code> (see <a href="CVS-Options.html#CVS-Options">CVS Options</a>), then Emacs avoids contacting a remote repository when
generating the VC Directory buffer (it will still contact it when
necessary, e.g., when doing a commit).  This may be desirable if you
are working offline or the network is slow.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddirectory_002dexclusion_002dlist-2822"></a>  The VC Directory buffer omits subdirectories listed in the variable
<code>vc-directory-exclusion-list</code>.  Its default value contains
directories that are used internally by version control systems.
