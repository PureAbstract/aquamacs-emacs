<h4 class="subsection">48.3.11 Disabling Commands</h4>

<p><a name="index-disabled-command-4443"></a>
  Disabling a command means that invoking it interactively asks for
confirmation from the user.  The purpose of disabling a command is to
prevent users from executing it by accident; we do this for commands
that might be confusing to the uninitiated.

   <p>Attempting to invoke a disabled command interactively in Emacs
displays a window containing the command's name, its documentation,
and some instructions on what to do immediately; then Emacs asks for
input saying whether to execute the command as requested, enable it
and execute it, or cancel.  If you decide to enable the command, you
must then answer another question&mdash;whether to do this permanently, or
just for the current session.  (Enabling permanently works by
automatically editing your initialization file.)  You can also type
<kbd>!</kbd> to enable <em>all</em> commands, for the current session only.

   <p>The direct mechanism for disabling a command is to put a
non-<code>nil</code> <code>disabled</code> property on the Lisp symbol for the
command.  Here is the Lisp program to do this:

<pre class="example">     (put 'delete-region 'disabled t)
</pre>
   <p>If the value of the <code>disabled</code> property is a string, that string
is included in the message displayed when the command is used:

<pre class="example">     (put 'delete-region 'disabled
          "It's better to use `kill-region' instead.\n")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-disable_002dcommand-4444"></a><a name="index-enable_002dcommand-4445"></a>  You can make a command disabled either by editing the initialization
file directly, or with the command <kbd>M-x disable-command</kbd>, which
edits the initialization file for you.  Likewise, <kbd>M-x
enable-command</kbd> edits the initialization file to enable a command
permanently.  See <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>.

   <p>If Emacs was invoked with the <samp><span class="option">-q</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--no-init-file</span></samp>
options (see <a href="Initial-Options.html#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>), it will not edit your
initialization file.  Doing so could lose information because Emacs
has not read your initialization file.

   <p>Whether a command is disabled is independent of what key is used to
invoke it; disabling also applies if the command is invoked using
<kbd>M-x</kbd>.  However, disabling a command has no effect on calling it
as a function from Lisp programs.
