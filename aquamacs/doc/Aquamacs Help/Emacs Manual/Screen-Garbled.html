<h3 class="section">50.3 Garbage on the Screen</h3>

<p>If the text on a text terminal looks wrong, the first thing to do is
see whether it is wrong in the buffer.  Type <kbd>C-l</kbd> to redisplay
the entire screen.  If the screen appears correct after this, the
problem was entirely in the previous screen update.  (Otherwise, see
the following section.)

   <p>Display updating problems often result from an incorrect terminfo
entry for the terminal you are using.  The file <samp><span class="file">etc/TERMS</span></samp> in
the Emacs distribution gives the fixes for known problems of this
sort.  <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> contains general advice for these problems in
one of its sections.  If you seem to be using the right terminfo
entry, it is possible that there is a bug in the terminfo entry, or a
bug in Emacs that appears for certain terminal types.
