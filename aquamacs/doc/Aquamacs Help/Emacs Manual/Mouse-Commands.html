</dl>

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dpoint-1436"></a>  The most basic mouse command is <code>mouse-set-point</code>, which is
invoked by clicking with the left mouse button, <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, in the
text area of a window.  This moves point to the position where you
clicked.  If that window was not the selected window, it becomes the
selected window.

   <p><a name="index-x_002dmouse_002dclick_002dfocus_002dignore_002dposition-1437"></a>  Normally, if the frame you clicked in was not the selected frame, it
is made the selected frame, in addition to selecting the window and
setting the cursor.  On the X Window System, you can change this by
setting the variable <code>x-mouse-click-focus-ignore-position</code> to
<code>t</code>.  In that case, the initial click on an unselected frame just
selects the frame, without doing anything else; clicking again selects
the window and sets the cursor position.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002c-dragging-1438"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dset_002dregion-1439"></a>  Holding down <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> and &ldquo;dragging&rdquo; the mouse over a stretch
of text activates the region around that text
(<code>mouse-set-region</code>), placing the mark where you started holding
down the mouse button, and point where you release it (see <a href="Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>). 
In addition, the text in the region becomes the primary selection
(see <a href="Primary-Selection.html#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>).

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002ddrag_002dcopy_002dregion-1440"></a>  If you change the variable <code>mouse-drag-copy-region</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, dragging the mouse over a stretch of text also
adds the text to the kill ring.  The default is <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dscroll_002dmin_002dlines-1441"></a>  If you move the mouse off the top or bottom of the window while
dragging, the window scrolls at a steady rate until you move the mouse
back into the window.  This way, you can select regions that don't fit
entirely on the screen.  The number of lines scrolled per step depends
on how far away from the window edge the mouse has gone; the variable
<code>mouse-scroll-min-lines</code> specifies a minimum step size.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dprimary-1442"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dclick-1443"></a>  Clicking with the middle mouse button, <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd>, moves point to
the position where you clicked and inserts the contents of the primary
selection (<code>mouse-yank-primary</code>).  See <a href="Primary-Selection.html#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>. 
This behavior is consistent with other X applications.  Alternatively,
you can rebind <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> to <code>mouse-yank-at-click</code>, which
performs a yank at point.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dyank_002dat_002dpoint-1444"></a>  If you change the variable <code>mouse-yank-at-point</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> does not move point; it inserts
the text at point, regardless of where you clicked or even which of
the frame's windows you clicked on.  This variable affects both
<code>mouse-yank-primary</code> and <code>mouse-yank-at-click</code>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dsave_002dthen_002dkill-1445"></a>  Clicking with the right mouse button, <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd>, runs the
command <code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>.  This performs several actions
depending on where you click and the status of the region:

     <ul>
<li>If no region is active, clicking <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> activates the region,
placing the mark where point was and point at the clicked position.

     <li>If a region is active, clicking <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> adjusts the nearer end
of the region by moving it to the clicked position.  The adjusted
region's text is copied to the kill ring; if the text in the original
region was already on the kill ring, it replaces it there.

     <li>If you originally specified the region using a double or triple
<kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, so that the region is defined to consist of entire
words or lines (see <a href="Word-and-Line-Mouse.html#Word-and-Line-Mouse">Word and Line Mouse</a>), then adjusting the
region with <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> also proceeds by entire words or lines.

     <li>If you use <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> a second time consecutively, at the same
place, that kills the region already selected.  Thus, the simplest way
to kill text with the mouse is to click <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> at one end, then
click <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> twice at the other end.  To copy the text into the
kill ring without deleting it from the buffer, press <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd>
just once&mdash;or just drag across the text with <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>.  Then you
can copy it elsewhere by yanking it. 
</ul>

   <p>The <code>mouse-save-then-kill</code> command also obeys the variable
<code>mouse-drag-copy-region</code> (described above).  If the value is
non-<code>nil</code>, then whenever the command sets or adjusts the active
region, the text in the region is also added to the kill ring.  If the
latest kill ring entry had been added the same way, that entry is
replaced rather than making a new entry.

   <p>Whenever you set the region using any of the mouse commands
described above, the mark will be deactivated by any subsequent
unshifted cursor motion command, in addition to the usual ways of
deactivating the mark.  See <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>.

   <p><a name="index-mouse-wheel-1446"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dmode-1447"></a><a name="index-Mouse-Wheel-minor-mode-1448"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Mouse-Wheel-1449"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dfollow_002dmouse-1450"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dscroll_002damount-1451"></a><a name="index-mouse_002dwheel_002dprogressive_002dspeed-1452"></a>  Some mice have a &ldquo;wheel&rdquo; which can be used for scrolling.  Emacs
supports scrolling windows with the mouse wheel, by default, on most
graphical displays.  To toggle this feature, use <kbd>M-x
mouse-wheel-mode</kbd>.  The variables <code>mouse-wheel-follow-mouse</code> and
<code>mouse-wheel-scroll-amount</code> determine where and by how much
buffers are scrolled.  The variable
<code>mouse-wheel-progressive-speed</code> determines whether the scroll
speed is linked to how fast you move the wheel.
