<h3 class="section">20.6 Displaying a Buffer in a Window</h3>

<p>It is a common Emacs operation to display or &ldquo;pop up&rdquo; some buffer
in response to a user command.  There are several different ways in
which commands do this.

   <p>Many commands, like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>), display the
buffer by &ldquo;taking over&rdquo; the selected window, expecting that the
user's attention will be diverted to that buffer.  These commands
usually work by calling <code>switch-to-buffer</code> internally
(see <a href="Select-Buffer.html#Select-Buffer">Select Buffer</a>).

   <p><a name="index-display_002dbuffer-1410"></a>  Some commands try to display &ldquo;intelligently&rdquo;, trying not to take
over the selected window, e.g., by splitting off a new window and
displaying the desired buffer there.  Such commands, which include the
various help commands (see <a href="Help.html#Help">Help</a>), work by calling
<code>display-buffer</code> internally.  See <a href="Window-Choice.html#Window-Choice">Window Choice</a>, for details.

   <p>Other commands do the same as <code>display-buffer</code>, and
additionally select the displaying window so that you can begin
editing its buffer.  The command <kbd>C-x `</kbd> (<code>next-error</code>) is
one example (see <a href="Compilation-Mode.html#Compilation-Mode">Compilation Mode</a>).  Such commands work by calling
the function <code>pop-to-buffer</code> internally.  See <a href="../elisp/Switching-Buffers.html#Switching-Buffers">Switching to a Buffer in a Window</a>.

   <p>Commands with names ending in <code>-other-window</code> behave like
<code>display-buffer</code>, except that they never display in the selected
window.  Several of these commands are bound in the <kbd>C-x 4</kbd> prefix
key (see <a href="Pop-Up-Window.html#Pop-Up-Window">Pop Up Window</a>).

   <p>Commands with names ending in <code>-other-frame</code> behave like
<code>display-buffer</code>, except that they (i) never display in the
selected window and (ii) prefer to create a new frame to display the
desired buffer instead of splitting a window&mdash;as though the variable
<code>pop-up-frames</code> is set to <code>t</code> (see <a href="Window-Choice.html#Window-Choice">Window Choice</a>). 
Several of these commands are bound in the <kbd>C-x 5</kbd> prefix key.
