<h4 class="subsection">48.2.2 Hooks</h4>

<p><a name="index-hook-4363"></a><a name="index-running-a-hook-4364"></a>
  <dfn>Hooks</dfn> are an important mechanism for customizing Emacs.  A
hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called
on some well-defined occasion.  (This is called <dfn>running the
hook</dfn>.)  The individual functions in the list are called the <dfn>hook
functions</dfn> of the hook.  For example, the hook <code>kill-emacs-hook</code>
runs just before exiting Emacs (see <a href="Exiting.html#Exiting">Exiting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-normal-hook-4365"></a>  Most hooks are <dfn>normal hooks</dfn>.  This means that when Emacs runs
the hook, it calls each hook function in turn, with no arguments.  We
have made an effort to keep most hooks normal, so that you can use
them in a uniform way.  Every variable whose name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo;
is a normal hook.

   <p><a name="index-abnormal-hook-4366"></a>  A few hooks are <dfn>abnormal hooks</dfn>.  Their names end in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>&rsquo;, instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo; (some old code may also use
the deprecated suffix &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hooks</span></samp>&rsquo;).  What
makes these hooks abnormal is the way its functions are
called&mdash;perhaps they are given arguments, or perhaps the values they
return are used in some way.  For example,
<code>find-file-not-found-functions</code> is abnormal because as soon as
one hook function returns a non-<code>nil</code> value, the rest are not
called at all (see <a href="Visiting.html#Visiting">Visiting</a>).  The documentation of each abnormal
hook variable explains how its functions are used.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dhook-4367"></a>  You can set a hook variable with <code>setq</code> like any other Lisp
variable, but the recommended way to add a function to a hook (either
normal or abnormal) is to use <code>add-hook</code>, as shown by the
following examples.  See <a href="../elisp/Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>, for details.

   <p>Most major modes run one or more <dfn>mode hooks</dfn> as the last step
of initialization.  Mode hooks are a convenient way to customize the
behavior of individual modes; they are always normal.  For example,
here's how to set up a hook to turn on Auto Fill mode in Text mode and
other modes based on Text mode:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This works by calling <code>auto-fill-mode</code>, which enables the minor
mode when no argument is supplied (see <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  Next,
suppose you don't want Auto Fill mode turned on in LaTeX mode,
which is one of the modes based on Text mode.  You can do this with
the following additional line:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook (lambda () (auto-fill-mode -1)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here we have used the special macro <code>lambda</code> to construct an
anonymous function (see <a href="../elisp/Lambda-Expressions.html#Lambda-Expressions">Lambda Expressions</a>), which calls <code>auto-fill-mode</code> with an argument
of <code>-1</code> to disable the minor mode.  Because LaTeX mode runs
<code>latex-mode-hook</code> after running <code>text-mode-hook</code>, the result
leaves Auto Fill mode disabled.

   <p>Here is a more complex example, showing how to use a hook to
customize the indentation of C code:

<pre class="example">     (setq my-c-style
       '((c-comment-only-line-offset . 4)
         (c-cleanup-list . (scope-operator
                            empty-defun-braces
                            defun-close-semi))))
     
     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
       (lambda () (c-add-style "my-style" my-c-style t)))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Prog-mode-4368"></a><a name="index-program-editing-4369"></a>  Major mode hooks also apply to other major modes <dfn>derived</dfn> from
the original mode (see <a href="../elisp/Derived-Modes.html#Derived-Modes">Derived Modes</a>).  For instance, HTML mode is derived from Text mode
(see <a href="HTML-Mode.html#HTML-Mode">HTML Mode</a>); when HTML mode is enabled, it runs
<code>text-mode-hook</code> before running <code>html-mode-hook</code>.  This
provides a convenient way to use a single hook to affect several
related modes.  In particular, if you want to apply a hook function to
any programming language mode, add it to <code>prog-mode-hook</code>; Prog
mode is a major mode that does little else than to let other major
modes inherit from it, exactly for this purpose.

   <p>It is best to design your hook functions so that the order in which
they are executed does not matter.  Any dependence on the order is
asking for trouble.  However, the order is predictable: the hook
functions are executed in the order they appear in the hook.

   <p><a name="index-remove_002dhook-4370"></a>  If you play with adding various different versions of a hook
function by calling <code>add-hook</code> over and over, remember that all
the versions you added will remain in the hook variable together.  You
can clear out individual functions by calling <code>remove-hook</code>, or
do <code>(setq </code><var>hook-variable</var><code> nil)</code> to remove everything.

   <p><a name="index-buffer_002dlocal-hooks-4371"></a>  If the hook variable is buffer-local, the buffer-local variable will
be used instead of the global variable.  However, if the buffer-local
variable contains the element <code>t</code>, the global hook variable will
be run as well.
