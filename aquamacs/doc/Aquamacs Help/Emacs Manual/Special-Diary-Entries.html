<h4 class="subsection">31.10.5 Special Diary Entries</h4>

<p>In addition to entries based on calendar dates, the diary file can
contain <dfn>sexp entries</dfn> for regular events such as anniversaries. 
These entries are based on Lisp expressions (sexps) that Emacs evaluates
as it scans the diary file.  Instead of a date, a sexp entry contains
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by a Lisp expression which must begin and end with
parentheses.  The Lisp expression determines which dates the entry
applies to.

   <p>Calendar mode provides commands to insert certain commonly used
sexp entries:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>i a</kbd><dd>Add an anniversary diary entry for the selected date
(<code>diary-insert-anniversary-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i b</kbd><dd>Add a block diary entry for the current region
(<code>diary-insert-block-entry</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>i c</kbd><dd>Add a cyclic diary entry starting at the date
(<code>diary-insert-cyclic-entry</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-i-a-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3402"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002danniversary_002dentry-3403"></a>  If you want to make a diary entry that applies to the anniversary of a
specific date, move point to that date and use the <kbd>i a</kbd> command. 
This displays the end of your diary file in another window and inserts
the anniversary description; you can then type the rest of the diary
entry.  The entry looks like this:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002danniversary-3404"></a>
<pre class="example">     %%(diary-anniversary 10 31 1948) Arthur's birthday
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This entry applies to October 31 in any year after 1948; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">10 31
1948</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies the date.  (If you are using the European or ISO
calendar style, the input order of month, day and year is different.) 
The reason this expression requires a beginning year is that advanced
diary functions can use it to calculate the number of elapsed years.

   <p>A <dfn>block</dfn> diary entry applies to a specified range of consecutive
dates.  Here is a block diary entry that applies to all dates from June
24, 2012 through July 10, 2012:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dblock-3405"></a>
<pre class="example">     %%(diary-block 6 24 2012 7 10 2012) Vacation
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">6 24 2012</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates the starting date and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">7 10 2012</span></samp>&rsquo;
indicates the stopping date.  (Again, if you are using the European or ISO
calendar style, the input order of month, day and year is different.)

   <p><a name="index-i-b-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3406"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002dblock_002dentry-3407"></a>  To insert a block entry, place point and the mark on the two
dates that begin and end the range, and type <kbd>i b</kbd>.  This command
displays the end of your diary file in another window and inserts the
block description; you can then type the diary entry.

   <p><a name="index-i-c-_0040r_007b_0028Calendar-mode_0029_007d-3408"></a><a name="index-diary_002dinsert_002dcyclic_002dentry-3409"></a>   <dfn>Cyclic</dfn> diary entries repeat after a fixed interval of days.  To
create one, select the starting date and use the <kbd>i c</kbd> command.  The
command prompts for the length of interval, then inserts the entry,
which looks like this:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dcyclic-3410"></a>
<pre class="example">     %%(diary-cyclic 50 3 1 2012) Renew medication
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This entry applies to March 1, 2012 and every 50th day following;
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3 1 2012</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies the starting date.  (If you are using the
European or ISO calendar style, the input order of month, day and year
is different.)

   <p>All three of these commands make marking diary entries.  To insert a
nonmarking entry, give a prefix argument to the command.  For example,
<kbd>C-u i a</kbd> makes a nonmarking anniversary diary entry.

   <p>Marking sexp diary entries in the calendar can be time-consuming,
since every date visible in the calendar window must be individually
checked.  So it's a good idea to make sexp diary entries nonmarking
(with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;) when possible.

   <p>Another sophisticated kind of sexp entry, a <dfn>floating</dfn> diary entry,
specifies a regularly occurring event by offsets specified in days,
weeks, and months.  It is comparable to a crontab entry interpreted by
the <code>cron</code> utility.  Here is a nonmarking, floating diary entry
that applies to the fourth Thursday in November:

   <p><a name="index-diary_002dfloat-3411"></a>
<pre class="example">     &amp;%%(diary-float 11 4 4) American Thanksgiving
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The 11 specifies November (the eleventh month), the 4 specifies Thursday
(the fourth day of the week, where Sunday is numbered zero), and the
second 4 specifies the fourth Thursday (1 would mean &ldquo;first&rdquo;, 2 would
mean &ldquo;second&rdquo;, &minus;2 would mean &ldquo;second-to-last&rdquo;, and so on). 
The month can be a single month or a list of months.  Thus you could change
the 11 above to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'(1 2 3)</span></samp>&rsquo; and have the entry apply to the last
Thursday of January, February, and March.  If the month is <code>t</code>, the
entry applies to all months of the year.

   <p>Each of the standard sexp diary entries takes an optional parameter
specifying the name of a face or a single-character string to use when
marking the entry in the calendar.  Most generally, sexp diary entries
can perform arbitrary computations to determine when they apply.
