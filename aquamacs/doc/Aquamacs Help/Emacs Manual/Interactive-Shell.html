<h3 class="section">41.2 Interactive Inferior Shell</h3>

<p><a name="index-shell-3633"></a>  To run a subshell interactively, use <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>.  This creates
(or reuses) a buffer named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*shell*</span></samp>&rsquo; and runs a subshell with
input coming from and output going to that buffer.  That is to say,
any &ldquo;terminal output&rdquo; from the subshell goes into the buffer,
advancing point, and any &ldquo;terminal input&rdquo; for the subshell comes
from text in the buffer.  To give input to the subshell, go to the end
of the buffer and type the input, terminated by &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>Emacs does not wait for the subshell to do anything.  You can switch
windows or buffers and edit them while the shell is waiting, or while it is
running a command.  Output from the subshell waits until Emacs has time to
process it; this happens whenever Emacs is waiting for keyboard input or
for time to elapse.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcomint_002dhighlight_002dinput_007d-face-3634"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcomint_002dhighlight_002dprompt_007d-face-3635"></a>  Input lines, once you submit them, are displayed using the face
<code>comint-highlight-input</code>, and prompts are displayed using the
face <code>comint-highlight-prompt</code>.  This makes it easier to see
previous input lines in the buffer.  See <a href="Faces.html#Faces">Faces</a>.

   <p>To make multiple subshells, you can invoke <kbd>M-x shell</kbd> with a
prefix argument (e.g. <kbd>C-u M-x shell</kbd>), which will read a buffer
name and create (or reuse) a subshell in that buffer.  You can also
rename the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*shell*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer using <kbd>M-x rename-uniquely</kbd>, then
create a new &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*shell*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer using plain <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>. 
Subshells in different buffers run independently and in parallel.

   <p><a name="index-explicit_002dshell_002dfile_002dname-3636"></a><a name="index-environment-variables-for-subshells-3637"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bESHELL_007d-environment-variable-3638"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bSHELL_007d-environment-variable-3639"></a>  The file name used to load the subshell is the value of the variable
<code>explicit-shell-file-name</code>, if that is non-<code>nil</code>. 
Otherwise, the environment variable <samp><span class="env">ESHELL</span></samp> is used, or the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> if there is no <samp><span class="env">ESHELL</span></samp>.  If the
file name specified is relative, the directories in the list
<code>exec-path</code> are searched; this list is initialized based on the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> when Emacs is started.  Your init file
can override either or both of these default initializations. 
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).

   <p>Emacs sends the new shell the contents of the file
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs_</span><var>shellname</var></samp> as input, if it exists, where
<var>shellname</var> is the name of the file that the shell was loaded
from.  For example, if you use bash, the file sent to it is
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs_bash</span></samp>.  If this file is not found, Emacs tries to fallback
on <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/init_</span><var>shellname</var><span class="file">.sh</span></samp>.

   <p>To specify a coding system for the shell, you can use the command
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c</kbd> immediately before <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>.  You can
also change the coding system for a running subshell by typing
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; p</kbd> in the shell buffer.  See <a href="Communication-Coding.html#Communication-Coding">Communication Coding</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bINSIDE_005fEMACS_007d-environment-variable-3640"></a>  Emacs sets the environment variable <samp><span class="env">INSIDE_EMACS</span></samp> in the
subshell to a comma-separated list including the Emacs version. 
Programs can check this variable to determine whether they are running
inside an Emacs subshell.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bEMACS_007d-environment-variable-3641"></a>  Emacs also sets the <samp><span class="env">EMACS</span></samp> environment variable (to <code>t</code>) if
it is not already defined.  <strong>Warning:</strong> This environment
variable is deprecated.  Programs that check this variable should be
changed to check <samp><span class="env">INSIDE_EMACS</span></samp> instead.
