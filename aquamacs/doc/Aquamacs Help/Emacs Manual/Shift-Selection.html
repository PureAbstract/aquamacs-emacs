<h3 class="section">11.6 Shift Selection</h3>

<p><a name="index-shift_002dselection-392"></a>
  If you hold down the shift key while typing a cursor motion command,
this sets the mark before moving point, so that the region extends
from the original position of point to its new position.  This feature
is referred to as <dfn>shift-selection</dfn>.  It is similar to the way
text is selected in other editors.

   <p>The mark set via shift-selection behaves a little differently from
what we have described above.  Firstly, in addition to the usual ways
of deactivating the mark (such as changing the buffer text or typing
<kbd>C-g</kbd>), the mark is deactivated by any <em>unshifted</em> cursor
motion command.  Secondly, any subsequent <em>shifted</em> cursor motion
command avoids setting the mark anew.  Therefore, a series of shifted
cursor motion commands will continuously adjust the region.

   <p>Shift-selection only works if the shifted cursor motion key is not
already bound to a separate command (see <a href="Customization.html#Customization">Customization</a>).  For
example, if you bind <kbd>S-C-f</kbd> to another command, typing
<kbd>S-C-f</kbd> runs that command instead of performing a shift-selected
version of <kbd>C-f</kbd> (<code>forward-char</code>).

   <p>A mark set via mouse commands behaves the same as a mark set via
shift-selection (see <a href="Setting-Mark.html#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).  For example, if you specify a
region by dragging the mouse, you can continue to extend the region
using shifted cursor motion commands.  In either case, any unshifted
cursor motion command deactivates the mark.

   <p>To turn off shift-selection, set <code>shift-select-mode</code> to
<code>nil</code>.  Doing so does not disable setting the mark via mouse
commands.
