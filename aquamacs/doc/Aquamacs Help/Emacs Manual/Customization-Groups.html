<h4 class="subsection">48.1.1 Customization Groups</h4>

<p><a name="index-customization-groups-4310"></a>
  Customization settings are organized into <dfn>customization
groups</dfn>.  These groups are collected into bigger groups, all the way
up to a master group called <code>Emacs</code>.

   <p><kbd>M-x customize</kbd> creates a customization buffer that shows the
top-level <code>Emacs</code> group.  It looks like this, in part:

<!-- we want the buffer example to all be on one page, but unfortunately -->
<!-- that's quite a bit of text, so force all space to the bottom. -->
<!-- @page -->
<pre class="smallexample">     To apply changes, use the Save or Set buttons.
     For details, see [Saving Customizations] in the [Emacs manual].
     
     ________________________________________ [ Search ]
     
      Operate on all settings in this buffer:
      [ Set for current session ] [ Save for future sessions ]
      [ Undo edits ] [ Reset to saved ] [ Erase customizations ] [ Exit ]
     
     
     Emacs group: Customization of the One True Editor.
           [State]: visible group members are all at standard values.
           See also [Manual].
     
     [Editing] : Basic text editing facilities.
     
     [Convenience] : Convenience features for faster editing.
     
     <var>more second-level groups</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The main part of this buffer shows the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Emacs</span></samp>&rsquo; customization
group, which contains several other groups (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Editing</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Convenience</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.).  The contents of those groups are not
listed here, only one line of documentation each.

   <p>The <dfn>state</dfn> of the group indicates whether setting in that group
has been edited, set or saved.  See <a href="Changing-a-Variable.html#Changing-a-Variable">Changing a Variable</a>.

   <p><a name="index-editable-fields-_0028customization-buffer_0029-4311"></a><a name="index-buttons-_0028customization-buffer_0029-4312"></a><a name="index-links-_0028customization-buffer_0029-4313"></a>  Most of the customization buffer is read-only, but it includes some
<dfn>editable fields</dfn> that you can edit.  For example, at the top of
the customization buffer is an editable field for searching for
settings (see <a href="Browsing-Custom.html#Browsing-Custom">Browsing Custom</a>).  There are also <dfn>buttons</dfn> and
<dfn>links</dfn>, which you can activate by either clicking with the mouse,
or moving point there and typing &lt;RET&gt;.  For example, the group
names like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Editing]</span></samp>&rsquo; are links; activating one of these links
brings up the customization buffer for that group.

   <p><a name="index-TAB-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4314"></a><a name="index-S_002dTAB-_0040r_007b_0028customization-buffer_0029_007d-4315"></a><a name="index-widget_002dforward-4316"></a><a name="index-widget_002dbackward-4317"></a>  In the customizable buffer, you can type &lt;TAB&gt;
(<code>widget-forward</code>) to move forward to the next button or editable
field.  <kbd>S-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> (<code>widget-backward</code>) moves back to the
previous button or editable field.
