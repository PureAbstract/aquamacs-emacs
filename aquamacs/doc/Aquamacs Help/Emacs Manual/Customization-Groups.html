<h4 class="subsection">57.2.1 Customization Groups</h4>

<p><a name="index-customization-groups-3938"></a>
  For customization purposes, settings are organized into <dfn>groups</dfn>
to help you find them.  Groups are collected into bigger groups, all
the way up to a master group called <code>Emacs</code>.

   <p><kbd>M-x customize</kbd> creates a customization buffer that shows the
top-level <code>Emacs</code> group and the second-level groups immediately
under it.  It looks like this, in part:

<!-- we want the buffer example to all be on one page, but unfortunately -->
<!-- that's quite a bit of text, so force all space to the bottom. -->
<pre class="smallexample">     /- Emacs group: Customization of the One True Editor. -------------\
           [State]: visible group members are all at standard values.
     
        See also [Manual].
     
     [Editing] : Basic text editing facilities.
     
     [External] : Interfacing to external utilities.
     
     <var>more second-level groups</var>
     
     \- Emacs group end ------------------------------------------------/
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This says that the buffer displays the contents of the <code>Emacs</code>
group.  The other groups are listed because they are its contents.  But
they are listed differently, without indentation and dashes, because
<em>their</em> contents are not included.  Each group has a single-line
documentation string; the <code>Emacs</code> group also has a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>&rsquo;
line.

   <p><a name="index-editable-fields-_0028customization-buffer_0029-3939"></a><a name="index-buttons-_0028customization-buffer_0029-3940"></a><a name="index-links-_0028customization-buffer_0029-3941"></a>  Most of the text in the customization buffer is read-only, but it
typically includes some <dfn>editable fields</dfn> that you can edit. 
There are also <dfn>buttons</dfn> and <dfn>links</dfn>, which do something when
you <dfn>invoke</dfn> them.  To invoke a button or a link, either click on
it with <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, or move point to it and type &lt;RET&gt;.

   <p>For example, the phrase &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[State]</span></samp>&rsquo; that appears in a
second-level group is a button.  It operates on the same customization
buffer.  Each group name, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Editing]</span></samp>&rsquo;, is a hypertext
link to that group; invoking it creates a new customization buffer,
showing the group and its contents.

   <p>The <code>Emacs</code> group only contains other groups.  These groups, in
turn, can contain settings or still more groups.  By browsing the
hierarchy of groups, you will eventually find the feature you are
interested in customizing.  Then you can use the customization buffer
to set that feature's settings.  You can also go straight to a
particular group by name, using the command <kbd>M-x customize-group</kbd>.
