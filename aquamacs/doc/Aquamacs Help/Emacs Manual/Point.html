<p><a name="index-point-3"></a><a name="index-cursor-4"></a>
  The cursor in the selected window shows the location where most
editing commands take effect, which is called <dfn>point</dfn><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Many Emacs commands move point
to different places in the buffer; for example, you can place point by
clicking mouse button 1 (normally the left button) at the desired
location.

   <p>By default, the cursor in the selected window is drawn as a solid
block and appears to be <em>on</em> a character, but you should think of
point as <em>between</em> two characters; it is situated <em>before</em>
the character under the cursor.  For example, if your text looks like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">frob</span></samp>&rsquo; with the cursor over the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, then point is between
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">o</span></samp>&rsquo; and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you insert the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;
at that position, the result is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fro!b</span></samp>&rsquo;, with point between the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;  and the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, the cursor remains over the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;, as before.

   <p>If you are editing several files in Emacs, each in its own buffer,
each buffer has its own value of point.  A buffer that is not
currently displayed remembers its value of point if you later display
it again.  Furthermore, if a buffer is displayed in multiple windows,
each of those windows has its own value of point.

   <p>See <a href="Cursor-Display.html#Cursor-Display">Cursor Display</a>, for options that control how Emacs displays
the cursor.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The
term &ldquo;point&rdquo; comes from the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;, which was the
command in TECO (the language in which the original Emacs was written)
for accessing the editing position.</p>
