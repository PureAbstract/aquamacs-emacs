<dt><kbd>C-x o</kbd><dd>Select another window (<code>other-window</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-M-v</kbd><dd>Scroll the next window (<code>scroll-other-window</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-1</kbd><dd><kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, in the text area of a window, selects the window and
moves point to the position clicked.  Clicking in the mode line
selects the window without moving point in it. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-o-1379"></a><a name="index-other_002dwindow-1380"></a>With the keyboard, you can switch windows by typing <kbd>C-x o</kbd>
(<code>other-window</code>).  That is an <kbd>o</kbd>, for &ldquo;other&rdquo;, not a zero. 
When there are more than two windows, this command moves through all the
windows in a cyclic order, generally top to bottom and left to right. 
After the rightmost and bottommost window, it goes back to the one at
the upper left corner.  A numeric argument means to move several steps
in the cyclic order of windows.  A negative argument moves around the
cycle in the opposite order.  When the minibuffer is active, the
minibuffer is the last window in the cycle; you can switch from the
minibuffer window to one of the other windows, and later switch back and
finish supplying the minibuffer argument that is requested. 
See <a href="Minibuffer-Edit.html#Minibuffer-Edit">Minibuffer Edit</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dM_002dv-1381"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dother_002dwindow-1382"></a>  The usual scrolling commands (see <a href="Display.html#Display">Display</a>) apply to the selected
window only, but there is one command to scroll the next window. 
<kbd>C-M-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-other-window</code>) scrolls the window that
<kbd>C-x o</kbd> would select.  It takes arguments, positive and negative,
like <kbd>C-v</kbd>.  (In the minibuffer, <kbd>C-M-v</kbd> scrolls the help
window associated with the minibuffer, if any, rather than the next
window in the standard cyclic order; see <a href="Minibuffer-Edit.html#Minibuffer-Edit">Minibuffer Edit</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-mouse_002dautoselect_002dwindow-1383"></a>  If you set <code>mouse-autoselect-window</code> to a non-<code>nil</code> value,
moving the mouse over a different window selects that window.  This
feature is off by default.
