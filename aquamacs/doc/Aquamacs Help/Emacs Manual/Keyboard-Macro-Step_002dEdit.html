<h3 class="section">17.7 Stepwise Editing a Keyboard Macro</h3>

<p><a name="index-kmacro_002dstep_002dedit_002dmacro-1001"></a><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dk-SPC-1002"></a>  You can interactively replay and edit the last keyboard
macro, one command at a time, by typing <kbd>C-x C-k SPC</kbd>
(<code>kmacro-step-edit-macro</code>).  Unless you quit the macro using
<kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-g</kbd>, the edited macro replaces the last macro on the
macro ring.

   <p>This macro editing feature shows the last macro in the minibuffer
together with the first (or next) command to be executed, and prompts
you for an action.  You can enter <kbd>?</kbd> to get a summary of your
options.  These actions are available:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>SPC</kbd> and <kbd>y</kbd> execute the current command, and advance to the
next command in the keyboard macro. 
<li><kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>, and <kbd>DEL</kbd> skip and delete the current command. 
<li><kbd>f</kbd> skips the current command in this execution of the keyboard
macro, but doesn't delete it from the macro. 
<li><kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> executes the current command, as well as all similar
commands immediately following the current command; for example, &lt;TAB&gt;
may be used to insert a sequence of characters (corresponding to a
sequence of <code>self-insert-command</code> commands). 
<li><kbd>c</kbd> continues execution (without further editing) until the end of
the keyboard macro.  If execution terminates normally, the edited
macro replaces the original keyboard macro. 
<li><kbd>C-k</kbd> skips and deletes the rest of the keyboard macro,
terminates step-editing, and replaces the original keyboard macro
with the edited macro. 
<li><kbd>q</kbd> and <kbd>C-g</kbd> cancels the step-editing of the keyboard macro;
discarding any changes made to the keyboard macro. 
<li><kbd>i KEY... C-j</kbd> reads and executes a series of key sequences (not
including the final <kbd>C-j</kbd>), and inserts them before the current
command in the keyboard macro, without advancing over the current
command. 
<li><kbd>I KEY...</kbd> reads one key sequence, executes it, and inserts it
before the current command in the keyboard macro, without advancing
over the current command. 
<li><kbd>r KEY... C-j</kbd> reads and executes a series of key sequences (not
including the final <kbd>C-j</kbd>), and replaces the current command in
the keyboard macro with them, advancing over the inserted key
sequences. 
<li><kbd>R KEY...</kbd> reads one key sequence, executes it, and replaces the
current command in the keyboard macro with that key sequence,
advancing over the inserted key sequence. 
<li><kbd>a KEY... C-j</kbd> executes the current command, then reads and
executes a series of key sequences (not including the final
<kbd>C-j</kbd>), and inserts them after the current command in the keyboard
macro; it then advances over the current command and the inserted key
sequences. 
<li><kbd>A KEY... C-j</kbd> executes the rest of the commands in the keyboard
macro, then reads and executes a series of key sequences (not
including the final <kbd>C-j</kbd>), and appends them at the end of the
keyboard macro; it then terminates the step-editing and replaces the
original keyboard macro with the edited macro.
