<h3 class="section">11.7 Disabling Transient Mark Mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode_002c-Transient-Mark-393"></a><a name="index-Transient-Mark-mode-394"></a><a name="index-highlighting-region-395"></a><a name="index-region-highlighting-396"></a><a name="index-Zmacs-mode-397"></a><a name="index-transient_002dmark_002dmode-398"></a>
  The default behavior of the mark and region, in which setting the
mark activates it and highlights the region, is called Transient Mark
mode.  This is a minor mode that is enabled by default.  It can be
toggled with <kbd>M-x transient-mark-mode</kbd>, or with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Active
Region Highlighting</span></samp>&rsquo; menu item in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Options</span></samp>&rsquo; menu.  Turning it
off switches Emacs to an alternative mode of operation:

     <ul>
<li>Setting the mark, with commands like <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-x
C-x</kbd>, does not highlight the region.  Therefore, you can't tell by
looking where the mark is located; you have to remember.

     <p>The usual solution to this problem is to set the mark and then use it
soon, before you forget where it is.  You can also check where the
mark is by using <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd>, which exchanges the positions of the
point and the mark (see <a href="Setting-Mark.html#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>).

     <li>Some commands, which ordinarily act on the region when the mark is
active, no longer do so.  For example, normally <kbd>M-%</kbd>
(<code>query-replace</code>) performs replacements within the region, if the
mark is active.  When Transient Mark mode is off, it always operates
from point to the end of the buffer.  Commands that act this way are
identified in their own documentation. 
</ul>

   <p>While Transient Mark mode is off, you can activate it temporarily
using <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>C-u C-x C-x</kbd>.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-C_002d_0040key_007bSPC_007d-399"></a>Set the mark at point (like plain <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>) and enable
Transient Mark mode just once, until the mark is deactivated.  (This
is not really a separate command; you are using the <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
command twice.)

     <br><dt><kbd>C-u C-x C-x</kbd><dd><a name="index-C_002du-C_002dx-C_002dx-400"></a>Exchange point and mark, activate the mark and enable Transient Mark
mode temporarily, until the mark is next deactivated.  (This is the
<kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> command, <code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>, with a prefix
argument.) 
</dl>

   <p>These commands set or activate the mark, and enable Transient Mark
mode only until the mark is deactivated.  One reason you may want to
use them is that some commands operate on the entire buffer instead of
the region when Transient Mark mode is off.  Enabling Transient Mark
mode momentarily gives you a way to use these commands on the region.

   <p>When you specify a region with the mouse (see <a href="Setting-Mark.html#Setting-Mark">Setting Mark</a>), or
with shift-selection (see <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>), this likewise
activates Transient Mark mode temporarily and highlights the region.
