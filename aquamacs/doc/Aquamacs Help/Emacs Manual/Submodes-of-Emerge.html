<h4 class="subsection">28.5.2 Submodes of Emerge</h4>

<p>You can choose between two modes for giving merge commands: Fast mode
and Edit mode.  In Fast mode, basic merge commands are single
characters, but ordinary Emacs commands are disabled.  This is
convenient if you use only merge commands.  In Edit mode, all merge
commands start with the prefix key <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, and the normal Emacs
commands are also available.  This allows editing the merge buffer, but
slows down Emerge operations.

   <p>Use <kbd>e</kbd> to switch to Edit mode, and <kbd>C-c C-c f</kbd> to switch to
Fast mode.  The mode line indicates Edit and Fast modes with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">E</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Emerge has two additional submodes that affect how particular merge
commands work: Auto Advance mode and Skip Prefers mode.

   <p>If Auto Advance mode is in effect, the <kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd> commands
advance to the next difference.  This lets you go through the merge
faster as long as you simply choose one of the alternatives from the
input.  The mode line indicates Auto Advance mode with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>If Skip Prefers mode is in effect, the <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>p</kbd> commands
skip over differences in states &ldquo;prefer-A&rdquo; and &ldquo;prefer-B&rdquo;
(see <a href="State-of-Difference.html#State-of-Difference">State of Difference</a>).  Thus you see only differences for
which neither version is presumed &ldquo;correct&rdquo;.  The mode line
indicates Skip Prefers mode with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This mode is only relevant
when there is an ancestor.

   <p><a name="index-emerge_002dauto_002dadvance-2924"></a><a name="index-emerge_002dskip_002dprefers-2925"></a>  Use the command <kbd>s a</kbd> (<code>emerge-auto-advance</code>) to set or clear
Auto Advance mode.  Use <kbd>s s</kbd> (<code>emerge-skip-prefers</code>) to set or
clear Skip Prefers mode.  These commands turn on the mode with a
positive argument, turn it off with a negative or zero argument, and
toggle the mode with no argument.
