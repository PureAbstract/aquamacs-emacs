<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.12.2 Deleting and Renaming Version-Controlled Files</h5>

<p><a name="index-renaming-version_002dcontrolled-files-2835"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x vc-delete-file</kbd><dd>Prompt for a file name, delete the file from the working tree, and
schedule the deletion for committing.

     <br><dt><kbd>M-x vc-rename-file</kbd><dd>Prompt for two file names, <var>VAR</var> and <var>OLD</var>, rename them in the
working tree, and schedule the renaming for committing. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-vc_002ddelete_002dfile-2836"></a>  If you wish to delete a version-controlled file, use the command
<kbd>M-x vc-delete-file</kbd>.  This prompts for the file name, and deletes
it via the version control system.  The file is removed from the
working tree, and in the VC Directory buffer
(see <a href="VC-Directory-Mode.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>),
it is displayed with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">removed</span></samp>&rsquo; status.  When you commit it,
the deletion takes effect in the repository.

   <p><a name="index-vc_002drename_002dfile-2837"></a>  To rename a version-controlled file, type <kbd>M-x vc-rename-file</kbd>. 
This prompts for two arguments: the name of the file you wish to
rename, and the new name; then it performs the renaming via the
version control system.  The renaming takes effect immediately in the
working tree, and takes effect in the repository when you commit the
renamed file.

   <p>On modern version control systems that have built-in support for
renaming, the renamed file retains the full change history of the
original file.  On CVS and older version control systems, the
<code>vc-rename-file</code> command actually works by creating a copy of the
old file under the new name, registering it, and deleting the old
file.  In this case, the change history is not preserved.
