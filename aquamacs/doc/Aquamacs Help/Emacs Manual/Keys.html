<h2 class="chapter">3 Keys</h2>

<p>Some Emacs commands are invoked by just one input event; for
example, <kbd>C-f</kbd> moves forward one character in the buffer.  Other
commands take two or more input events to invoke, such as <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 4 C-f</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-key-39"></a><a name="index-key-sequence-40"></a><a name="index-complete-key-41"></a><a name="index-prefix-key-42"></a>  A <dfn>key sequence</dfn>, or <dfn>key</dfn> for short, is a sequence of one
or more input events that is meaningful as a unit.  If a key sequence
invokes a command, we call it a <dfn>complete key</dfn>; for example,
<kbd>C-f</kbd>, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 4 C-f</kbd> are all complete keys. 
If a key sequence isn't long enough to invoke a command, we call it a
<dfn>prefix key</dfn>; from the preceding example, we see that <kbd>C-x</kbd>
and <kbd>C-x 4</kbd> are prefix keys.  Every key sequence is either a
complete key or a prefix key.

   <p>A prefix key combines with the following input event to make a
longer key sequence.  For example, <kbd>C-x</kbd> is a prefix key, so
typing <kbd>C-x</kbd> alone does not invoke a command; instead, Emacs waits
for further input (if you pause for longer than a second, it echoes
the <kbd>C-x</kbd> key to prompt for that input; see <a href="Echo-Area.html#Echo-Area">Echo Area</a>). 
<kbd>C-x</kbd> combines with the next input event to make a two-event key
sequence, which could itself be a prefix key (such as <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>), or
a complete key (such as <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>).  There is no limit to the
length of key sequences, but in practice they are seldom longer than
three or four input events.

   <p>You can't add input events onto a complete key.  For example,
because <kbd>C-f</kbd> is a complete key, the two-event sequence <kbd>C-f
C-k</kbd> is two key sequences, not one.

   <p>By default, the prefix keys in Emacs are <kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-h</kbd>,
<kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, <kbd>C-x @</kbd>, <kbd>C-x a</kbd>, <kbd>C-x
n</kbd>, <kbd>C-x r</kbd>, <kbd>C-x v</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 5</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 6</kbd>,
&lt;ESC&gt;, <kbd>M-g</kbd>, and <kbd>M-o</kbd>.  (&lt;F1&gt; and &lt;F2&gt; are
aliases for <kbd>C-h</kbd> and <kbd>C-x 6</kbd>.)  This list is not cast in
stone; if you customize Emacs, you can make new prefix keys.  You
could even eliminate some of the standard ones, though this is not
recommended for most users; for example, if you remove the prefix
definition of <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>, then <kbd>C-x 4 C-f</kbd> becomes an invalid key
sequence.  See <a href="Key-Bindings.html#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>.

   <p>Typing the help character (<kbd>C-h</kbd> or &lt;F1&gt;) after a prefix key
displays a list of the commands starting with that prefix.  The sole
exception to this rule is &lt;ESC&gt;: <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; C-h</kbd> is equivalent
to <kbd>C-M-h</kbd>, which does something else entirely.  You can, however,
use &lt;F1&gt; to display a list of commands starting with &lt;ESC&gt;.
