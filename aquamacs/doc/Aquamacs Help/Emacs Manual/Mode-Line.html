<h3 class="section">1.3 The Mode Line</h3>

<p><a name="index-mode-line-14"></a><a name="index-top-level-15"></a>
  At the bottom of each window is a <dfn>mode line</dfn>, which describes
what is going on in the current buffer.  When there is only one
window, the mode line appears right above the echo area; it is the
next-to-last line in the frame.  On a graphical display, the mode line
is drawn with a 3D box appearance.  Emacs also usually draws the mode
line of the selected window with a different color than that of
unselected windows, in order to make it stand out.

   <p>The text displayed in the mode line has the following format:

<pre class="example">      <var>cs</var>:<var>ch</var>-<var>fr</var>  <var>buf</var>      <var>pos</var> <var>line</var>   (<var>major</var> <var>minor</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On a text terminal, this text is followed by a series of dashes
extending to the right edge of the window.  These dashes are omitted
on a graphical display.

   <p>The <var>cs</var> string and the colon character after it describe the
character set and newline convention used for the current buffer. 
Normally, Emacs automatically handles these settings for you, but it
is sometimes useful to have this information.

   <p><var>cs</var> describes the character set of the text in the buffer
(see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>).  If it is a dash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;), that indicates
no special character set handling (with the possible exception of
end-of-line conventions, described in the next paragraph).  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;
means no conversion whatsoever, and is usually used for files
containing non-textual data.  Other characters represent various
<dfn>coding systems</dfn>&mdash;for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; represents ISO Latin-1.

   <p>On a text terminal, <var>cs</var> is preceded by two additional
characters that describe the coding systems for keyboard input and
terminal output.  Furthermore, if you are using an input method,
<var>cs</var> is preceded by a string that identifies the input method
(see <a href="Input-Methods.html#Input-Methods">Input Methods</a>).

   <p><a name="index-end_002dof_002dline-convention_002c-mode_002dline-indication-16"></a>  The character after <var>cs</var> is usually a colon.  If a different
string is displayed, that indicates a nontrivial end-of-line
convention for encoding a file.  Usually, lines of text are separated
by <dfn>newline characters</dfn> in a file, but two other conventions are
sometimes used.  The MS-DOS convention uses a &ldquo;carriage-return&rdquo;
character followed by a &ldquo;linefeed&rdquo; character; when editing such
files, the colon changes to either a backslash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;) or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(DOS)</span></samp>&rsquo;, depending on the operating system.  Another convention,
employed by older Macintosh systems, uses a &ldquo;carriage-return&rdquo;
character instead of a newline; when editing such files, the colon
changes to either a forward slash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo;) or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(Mac)</span></samp>&rsquo;.  On some
systems, Emacs displays &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(Unix)</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of the colon for files
that use newline as the line separator.

   <p>The next element on the mode line is the string indicated by
<var>ch</var>.  This shows two dashes (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--</span></samp>&rsquo;) if the buffer displayed
in the window has the same contents as the corresponding file on the
disk; i.e., if the buffer is &ldquo;unmodified&rdquo;.  If the buffer is
modified, it shows two stars (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">**</span></samp>&rsquo;).  For a read-only buffer, it
shows &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%*</span></samp>&rsquo; if the buffer is modified, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; otherwise.

   <p>The character after <var>ch</var> is normally a dash (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
However, if the default-directory for the current buffer is on a
remote machine, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; is displayed instead (see <a href="File-Names.html#File-Names">File Names</a>).

   <p><var>fr</var> gives the selected frame name (see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>).  It appears
only on text terminals.  The initial frame's name is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F1</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><var>buf</var> is the name of the buffer displayed in the window. 
Usually, this is the same as the name of a file you are editing. 
See <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>.

   <p><var>pos</var> tells you whether there is additional text above the top
of the window, or below the bottom.  If your buffer is small and all
of it is visible in the window, <var>pos</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">All</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Otherwise,
it is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Top</span></samp>&rsquo; if you are looking at the beginning of the buffer,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Bot</span></samp>&rsquo; if you are looking at the end of the buffer, or
&lsquo;<samp><var>nn</var><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>nn</var> is the percentage of the buffer above
the top of the window.  With Size Indication mode, you can display the
size of the buffer as well.  See <a href="Optional-Mode-Line.html#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.

   <p><var>line</var> is the character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by the line number at
point.  (You can display the current column number too, by turning on
Column Number mode.  See <a href="Optional-Mode-Line.html#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.)

   <p><var>major</var> is the name of the <dfn>major mode</dfn> used in the buffer. 
A major mode is a principal editing mode for the buffer, such as Text
mode, Lisp mode, C mode, and so forth.  See <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>.  Some
major modes display additional information after the major mode name. 
For example, Compilation buffers and Shell buffers display the status
of the subprocess.

   <p><var>minor</var> is a list of some of the enabled <dfn>minor modes</dfn>,
which are optional editing modes that provide additional features on
top of the major mode.  See <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>.

   <p>Some features are listed together with the minor modes whenever they
are turned on, even though they are not really minor modes. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Narrow</span></samp>&rsquo; means that the buffer being displayed has editing
restricted to only a portion of its text (see <a href="Narrowing.html#Narrowing">Narrowing</a>). 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Def</span></samp>&rsquo; means that a keyboard macro is currently being defined
(see <a href="Keyboard-Macros.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>).

   <p>In addition, if Emacs is inside a recursive editing level, square
brackets (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo;) appear around the parentheses that
surround the modes.  If Emacs is in one recursive editing level within
another, double square brackets appear, and so on.  Since recursive
editing levels affect Emacs globally, such square brackets appear in
the mode line of every window.  See <a href="Recursive-Edit.html#Recursive-Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

   <p>You can change the appearance of the mode line as well as the format
of its contents.  See <a href="Optional-Mode-Line.html#Optional-Mode-Line">Optional Mode Line</a>.  In addition, the mode
line is mouse-sensitive; clicking on different parts of the mode line
performs various commands.  See <a href="Mode-Line-Mouse.html#Mode-Line-Mouse">Mode Line Mouse</a>.
