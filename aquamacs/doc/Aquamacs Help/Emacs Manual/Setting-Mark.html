<h3 class="section">11.1 Setting the Mark</h3>

<p>Here are some commands for setting the mark:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, and activate it (<code>set-mark-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-@</kbd><dd>The same. 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-x</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, and activate it; then move point where the mark
used to be (<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>Drag-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Set point and the mark around the text you drag across. 
<br><dt><kbd>Mouse-3</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point, then move point to where you click
(<code>mouse-save-then-kill</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lsquo;</kbd><samp><span class="samp">Shifted cursor motion keys</span></samp><kbd>&rsquo;</kbd><dd>Set the mark at point if the mark is inactive, then move point. 
See <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dSPC-362"></a><a name="index-C_002d_0040_0040-363"></a><a name="index-set_002dmark_002dcommand-364"></a>  The most common way to set the mark is with <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>set-mark-command</code>)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  This sets the mark where point is,
and activates it.  You can then move point away, leaving the mark
behind.

   <p>For example, suppose you wish to convert part of the buffer to upper
case.  To accomplish this, go to one end of the desired text, type
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>, and move point until the desired portion of text is
highlighted.  Now type <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd> (<code>upcase-region</code>).  This
converts the text in the region to upper case, and then deactivates
the mark.

   <p>Whenever the mark is active, you can deactivate it by typing
<kbd>C-g</kbd> (see <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>).  Most commands that operate on the
region also automatically deactivate the mark, like <kbd>C-x C-u</kbd> in
the above example.

   <p>Instead of setting the mark in order to operate on a region, you can
also use it to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; a position in the buffer (by typing
<kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt; C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>), and later jump back there (by typing
<kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>).  See <a href="Mark-Ring.html#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>, for details.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dx-365"></a><a name="index-exchange_002dpoint_002dand_002dmark-366"></a>  The command <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> (<code>exchange-point-and-mark</code>) exchanges
the positions of point and the mark.  <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> is useful when you
are satisfied with the position of point but want to move the other
end of the region (where the mark is).  Using <kbd>C-x C-x</kbd> a second
time, if necessary, puts the mark at the new position with point back
at its original position.  Normally, if the mark is inactive, this
command first reactivates the mark wherever it was last set, to ensure
that the region is left highlighted.  However, if you call it with a
prefix argument, it leaves the mark inactive and the region
unhighlighted; you can use this to jump to the mark in a manner
similar to <kbd>C-u C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>You can also set the mark with the mouse.  If you press the left
mouse button (<kbd>down-mouse-1</kbd>) and drag the mouse across a range of
text, this sets the mark where you first pressed the mouse button and
puts point where you release it.  Alternatively, clicking the right
mouse button (<kbd>mouse-3</kbd>) sets the mark at point and then moves
point to where you clicked.  See <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>, for a more
detailed description of these mouse commands.

   <p><a name="index-shift_002dselection-367"></a>  Finally, you can set the mark by holding down the shift key while
typing certain cursor motion commands (such as <kbd>S-&lt;right&gt;</kbd>,
<kbd>S-C-f</kbd>, <kbd>S-C-n</kbd>, etc.).  This is called <dfn>shift-selection</dfn>. 
It sets the mark at point before moving point, but only if there is no
active mark set via shift-selection.  The mark set by mouse commands
and by shift-selection behaves slightly differently from the usual
mark: any subsequent unshifted cursor motion command deactivates it
automatically.  For details, See <a href="Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>.

   <p>Many commands that insert text, such as <kbd>C-y</kbd> (<code>yank</code>), set
the mark at the other end of the inserted text, without activating it. 
This lets you easily return to that position (see <a href="Mark-Ring.html#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>).  You
can tell that a command does this when it shows &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Mark set</span></samp>&rsquo; in the
echo area.

   <p><a name="index-primary-selection-368"></a>  Under X, every time the active region changes, Emacs saves the text
in the region to the <dfn>primary selection</dfn>.  This lets you insert
that text into other X applications with <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> clicks. 
See <a href="Primary-Selection.html#Primary-Selection">Primary Selection</a>.

   <div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> There is no <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
character in <acronym>ASCII</acronym>; usually, typing <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd> on a
text terminal gives the character <kbd>C-@</kbd>.  This key is also bound
to <code>set-mark-command</code>, so unless you are unlucky enough to have
a text terminal that behaves differently, you might as well think of
<kbd>C-@</kbd> as <kbd>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>.</p>
