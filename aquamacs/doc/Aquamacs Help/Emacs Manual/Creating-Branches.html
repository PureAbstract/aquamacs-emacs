<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.11.4 Creating New Branches</h5>

<p>On centralized version control systems like CVS, Emacs supports
creating new branches as part of a commit operation.  When committing
a modified VC fileset, type <kbd>C-u C-x v v</kbd> (<code>vc-next-action</code>
with a prefix argument; see <a href="Advanced-C_002dx-v-v.html#Advanced-C_002dx-v-v">Advanced C-x v v</a>).  Then Emacs prompts
for a revision ID for the new revision.  You should specify a suitable
branch ID for a branch starting at the current revision.  For example,
if the current revision is 2.5, the branch ID should be 2.5.1, 2.5.2,
and so on, depending on the number of existing branches at that point.

   <p>To create a new branch at an older revision (one that is no longer
the head of a branch), first select that revision (see <a href="Switching-Branches.html#Switching-Branches">Switching Branches</a>).  Your procedure will then differ depending on whether you
are using a locking or merging-based VCS.

   <p>On a locking VCS, you will need to lock the old revision branch with
<kbd>C-x v v</kbd>.  You'll be asked to confirm, when you lock the old
revision, that you really mean to create a new branch&mdash;if you say no,
you'll be offered a chance to lock the latest revision instead.  On a
merging-based VCS you will skip this step.

   <p>Then make your changes and type <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> again to commit a new
revision.  This creates a new branch starting from the selected
revision.

   <p>After the branch is created, subsequent commits create new revisions
on that branch.  To leave the branch, you must explicitly select a
different revision with <kbd>C-u C-x v v</kbd>.
