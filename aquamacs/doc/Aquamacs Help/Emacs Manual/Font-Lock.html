<h3 class="section">18.8 Font Lock mode</h3>

<p><a name="index-Font-Lock-mode-509"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Font-Lock-510"></a><a name="index-syntax-highlighting-and-coloring-511"></a>
  Font Lock mode is a minor mode, always local to a particular buffer,
which highlights (or &ldquo;fontifies&rdquo;) the buffer contents according to
the syntax of the text you are editing.  It can recognize comments and
strings in most programming languages; in several languages, it can
also recognize and properly highlight various other important
constructs, such as names of functions being defined or reserved
keywords.  Some special modes, such as Occur mode and Info mode, have
completely specialized ways of assigning fonts for Font Lock mode.

   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dmode-512"></a>  Font Lock mode is turned on by default in all modes which support it. 
You can toggle font-lock for each buffer with the command <kbd>M-x
font-lock-mode</kbd>.  Using a positive argument unconditionally turns Font
Lock mode on, and a negative or zero argument turns it off.

   <p><a name="index-global_002dfont_002dlock_002dmode-513"></a><a name="index-global_002dfont_002dlock_002dmode-514"></a>  If you do not wish Font Lock mode to be turned on by default,
customize the variable <code>global-font-lock-mode</code> using the Customize
interface (see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or use the function
<code>global-font-lock-mode</code> in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, like this:

<pre class="example">     (global-font-lock-mode 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This variable, like all the variables that control Font Lock mode,
take effect whenever fontification is done; that is, potentially at
any time.

   <p><a name="index-turn_002don_002dfont_002dlock-515"></a>  If you have disabled Global Font Lock mode, you can still enable Font
Lock for specific major modes by adding the function
<code>turn-on-font-lock</code> to the mode hooks (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>).  For
example, to enable Font Lock mode for editing C files, you can do this:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)
</pre>
   <p>Font Lock mode uses several specifically named faces to do its job,
including <code>font-lock-string-face</code>, <code>font-lock-comment-face</code>,
and others.  The easiest way to find them all is to use <kbd>M-x
customize-group &lt;RET&gt; font-lock-faces &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  You can then
use that customization buffer to customize the appearance of these
faces.  See <a href="Face-Customization.html#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>.

   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dmaximum_002ddecoration-516"></a>  The variable <code>font-lock-maximum-decoration</code> specifies the
preferred level of fontification, for modes that provide multiple
levels.  Level 1 is the least amount of fontification; some modes
support levels as high as 3.  The normal default is &ldquo;as high as
possible.&rdquo;  You can specify an integer, which applies to all modes, or
you can specify different numbers for particular major modes; for
example, to use level 1 for C/C++ modes, and the default level
otherwise, use this:

<pre class="example">     (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration
           '((c-mode . 1) (c++-mode . 1)))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dmaximum_002dsize-517"></a>  Fontification can be too slow for large buffers, so you can suppress
it for buffers above a certain size.  The variable
<code>font-lock-maximum-size</code> specifies a buffer size, beyond which
buffer fontification is suppressed.

<!-- @w is used below to prevent a bad page-break. -->
   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dbeginning_002dof_002dsyntax_002dfunction-518"></a><a name="index-incorrect-fontification-519"></a><a name="index-parenthesis-in-column-zero-and-fontification-520"></a><a name="index-brace-in-column-zero-and-fontification-521"></a>  Comment and string fontification (or &ldquo;syntactic&rdquo; fontification)
relies on analysis of the syntactic structure of the buffer text.  For
the sake of speed, some modes, including Lisp mode, rely on a special
convention: an open-parenthesis or open-brace in the leftmost column
always defines the beginning<!-- /@w --> of a defun, and is thus always
outside any string or comment.  (See <a href="Left-Margin-Paren.html#Left-Margin-Paren">Left Margin Paren</a>.)  If you
don't follow this convention, Font Lock mode can misfontify the text
that follows an open-parenthesis or open-brace in the leftmost column
that is inside a string or comment.

   <p><a name="index-slow-display-during-scrolling-522"></a>  The variable <code>font-lock-beginning-of-syntax-function</code> (always
buffer-local) specifies how Font Lock mode can find a position
guaranteed to be outside any comment or string.  In modes which use the
leftmost column parenthesis convention, the default value of the variable
is <code>beginning-of-defun</code>&mdash;that tells Font Lock mode to use the
convention.  If you set this variable to <code>nil</code>, Font Lock no longer
relies on the convention.  This avoids incorrect results, but the price
is that, in some cases, fontification for a changed text must rescan
buffer text from the beginning of the buffer.  This can considerably
slow down redisplay while scrolling, particularly if you are close to
the end of a large buffer.

   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dadd_002dkeywords-523"></a>  Font Lock highlighting patterns already exist for many modes, but you
may want to fontify additional patterns.  You can use the function
<code>font-lock-add-keywords</code>, to add your own highlighting patterns for
a particular mode.  For example, to highlight &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FIXME:</span></samp>&rsquo; words in C
comments, use this:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (font-lock-add-keywords nil
                 '(("\\&lt;\\(FIXME\\):" 1 font-lock-warning-face t)))))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-font_002dlock_002dremove_002dkeywords-524"></a>  To remove keywords from the font-lock highlighting patterns, use the
function <code>font-lock-remove-keywords</code>.  See <a href="../elisp/Search_002dbased-Fontification.html#Search_002dbased-Fontification">Search-based Fontification</a>.

   <p><a name="index-just_002din_002dtime-_0028JIT_0029-font_002dlock-525"></a><a name="index-background-syntax-highlighting-526"></a>  Fontifying large buffers can take a long time.  To avoid large
delays when a file is visited, Emacs fontifies only the visible
portion of a buffer.  As you scroll through the buffer, each portion
that becomes visible is fontified as soon as it is displayed; this
type of Font Lock is called <dfn>Just-In-Time</dfn> (or <dfn>JIT</dfn>) Lock. 
You can control how JIT Lock behaves, including telling it to perform
fontification while idle, by customizing variables in the
customization group &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">jit-lock</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="Specific-Customization.html#Specific-Customization">Specific Customization</a>.
