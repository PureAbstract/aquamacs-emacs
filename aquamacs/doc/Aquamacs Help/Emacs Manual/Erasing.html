     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;Backspace&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete the character before point, or the region if it is active
(<code>delete-backward-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;Delete&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete the character after point, or the region if it is active
(<code>delete-forward-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd>Delete the character after point (<code>delete-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-k</kbd><dd>Kill to the end of the line (<code>kill-line</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-d</kbd><dd>Kill forward to the end of the next word (<code>kill-word</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Kill back to the beginning of the previous word
(<code>backward-kill-word</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The <kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> (<code>delete-backward-char</code>) command removes
the character before point, moving the cursor and the characters after
it backwards.  If point was at the beginning of a line, this deletes
the preceding newline, joining this line to the previous one.

   <p>If, however, the region is active, <kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd> instead deletes
the text in the region.  See <a href="Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>, for a description of the region.

   <p>On most keyboards, &lt;DEL&gt; is labeled &lt;Backspace&gt;, but we
refer to it as &lt;DEL&gt; in this manual.  (Do not confuse &lt;DEL&gt;
with the &lt;Delete&gt; key; we will discuss &lt;Delete&gt; momentarily.) 
On some text terminals, Emacs may not recognize the &lt;DEL&gt; key
properly.  See <a href="DEL-Does-Not-Delete.html#DEL-Does-Not-Delete">DEL Does Not Delete</a>, if you encounter this problem.

   <p>The &lt;delete&gt; (<code>delete-forward-char</code>) command deletes in the
&ldquo;opposite direction&rdquo;: it deletes the character after point, i.e., the
character under the cursor.  If point was at the end of a line, this
joins the following line onto this one.  Like <kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd>, it
deletes the text in the region if the region is active (see <a href="Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>).

   <p><kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>delete-char</code>) deletes the character after point,
similar to &lt;delete&gt;, but regardless of whether the region is
active.

   <p>See <a href="Deletion.html#Deletion">Deletion</a>, for more detailed information about the above
deletion commands.

   <p><kbd>C-k</kbd> (<code>kill-line</code>) erases (kills) a line at a time.  If
you type <kbd>C-k</kbd> at the beginning or middle of a line, it kills all
the text up to the end of the line.  If you type <kbd>C-k</kbd> at the end
of a line, it joins that line with the following line.

   <p>See <a href="Killing.html#Killing">Killing</a>, for more information about <kbd>C-k</kbd> and related
commands.
