<h3 class="section">18.15 Quoted File Names</h3>

<p><a name="index-quoting-file-names-1235"></a><a name="index-file-names_002c-quote-special-characters-1236"></a>  You can <dfn>quote</dfn> an absolute file name to prevent special
characters and syntax in it from having their special effects. 
The way to do this is to add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning.

   <p>For example, you can quote a local file name which appears remote, to
prevent it from being treated as a remote file name.  Thus, if you have
a directory named <samp><span class="file">/foo:</span></samp> and a file named <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp> in it, you
can refer to that file in Emacs as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:/foo:/bar</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo; can also prevent &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; from being treated as a special
character for a user's home directory.  For example, <samp><span class="file">/:/tmp/~hack</span></samp>
refers to a file whose name is <samp><span class="file">~hack</span></samp> in directory <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp>.

   <p>Quoting with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo; is also a way to enter in the minibuffer a
file name that contains &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In order for this to work, the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo; must be at the beginning of the minibuffer contents.  (You
can also double each &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;; see <a href="File-Names-with-_0024.html#File-Names-with-_0024">File Names with $</a>.)

   <p>You can also quote wildcard characters with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo;, for visiting. 
For example, <samp><span class="file">/:/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp> visits the file
<samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp>.

   <p>Another method of getting the same result is to enter
<samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo[*]bar</span></samp>, which is a wildcard specification that matches
only <samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp>.  However, in many cases there is no need to
quote the wildcard characters because even unquoted they give the
right result.  For example, if the only file name in <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> that
starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; and ends with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo; is <samp><span class="file">foo*bar</span></samp>,
then specifying <samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp> will visit only
<samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo*bar</span></samp>.
