<h3 class="section">30.17 Editing the Dired Buffer</h3>

<p><a name="index-wdired-mode-3216"></a><a name="index-wdired_002dchange_002dto_002dwdired_002dmode-3217"></a>  Wdired is a special mode that allows you to perform file operations
by editing the Dired buffer directly (the &ldquo;W&rdquo; in &ldquo;Wdired&rdquo; stands
for &ldquo;writable&rdquo;.)  To enter Wdired mode, type <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd>
(<code>dired-toggle-read-only</code>) while in a Dired buffer. 
Alternatively, use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Immediate / Edit File Names</span></samp>&rsquo; menu item.

   <p><a name="index-wdired_002dfinish_002dedit-3218"></a>  While in Wdired mode, you can rename files by editing the file names
displayed in the Dired buffer.  All the ordinary Emacs editing
commands, including rectangle operations and <code>query-replace</code>, are
available for this.  Once you are done editing, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
(<code>wdired-finish-edit</code>).  This applies your changes and switches
back to ordinary Dired mode.

   <p>Apart from simply renaming files, you can move a file to another
directory by typing in the new file name (either absolute or
relative).  To mark a file for deletion, delete the entire file name. 
To change the target of a symbolic link, edit the link target name
which appears next to the link name.

   <p>The rest of the text in the buffer, such as the file sizes and
modification dates, is marked read-only, so you can't edit it. 
However, if you set <code>wdired-allow-to-change-permissions</code> to
<code>t</code>, you can edit the file permissions.  For example, you can
change &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-rw-r--r--</span></samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-rw-rw-rw-</span></samp>&rsquo; to make a file
world-writable.  These changes also take effect when you type <kbd>C-c
C-c</kbd>.
