<h4 class="subsection">8.4.3 Completion Exit</h4>

<p><a name="index-RET-_0040r_007b_0028completion-in-minibuffer_0029_007d-209"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002dcomplete_002dand_002dexit-210"></a>  When a command reads an argument using the minibuffer with
completion, it also controls what happens when you type &lt;RET&gt;
(<code>minibuffer-complete-and-exit</code>) to submit the argument.  There
are four types of behavior:

     <ul>
<li><dfn>Strict completion</dfn> accepts only exact completion matches.  Typing
&lt;RET&gt; exits the minibuffer only if the minibuffer text is an exact
match, or completes to one.  Otherwise, Emacs refuses to exit the
minibuffer; instead it tries to complete, and if no completion can be
done it momentarily displays &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[No match]</span></samp>&rsquo; after the minibuffer
text.  (You can still leave the minibuffer by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> to
cancel the command.)

     <p>An example of a command that uses this behavior is <kbd>M-x</kbd>, since it
is meaningless for it to accept a non-existent command name.

     <li><dfn>Cautious completion</dfn> is like strict completion, except &lt;RET&gt;
exits only if the text is already an exact match.  If the text
completes to an exact match, &lt;RET&gt; performs that completion but
does not exit yet; you must type a second &lt;RET&gt; to exit.

     <p>Cautious completion is used for reading file names for files that must
already exist, for example.

     <li><dfn>Permissive completion</dfn> allows any input; the completion
candidates are just suggestions.  Typing &lt;RET&gt; does not complete,
it just submits the argument as you have entered it.

     <p><a name="index-minibuffer-confirmation-211"></a><a name="index-confirming-in-the-minibuffer-212"></a><li><dfn>Permissive completion with confirmation</dfn> is like permissive
completion, with an exception: if you typed &lt;TAB&gt; and this
completed the text up to some intermediate state (i.e., one that is not
yet an exact completion match), typing &lt;RET&gt; right afterward does
not submit the argument.  Instead, Emacs asks for confirmation by
momentarily displaying &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[Confirm]</span></samp>&rsquo; after the text; type &lt;RET&gt;
again to confirm and submit the text.  This catches a common mistake,
in which one types &lt;RET&gt; before realizing that &lt;TAB&gt; did not
complete as far as desired.

     <p><a name="index-confirm_002dnonexistent_002dfile_002dor_002dbuffer-213"></a>You can tweak the confirmation behavior by customizing the variable
<code>confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer</code>.  The default value,
<code>after-completion</code>, gives the behavior we have just described. 
If you change it to <code>nil</code>, Emacs does not ask for confirmation,
falling back on permissive completion.  If you change it to any other
non-<code>nil</code> value, Emacs asks for confirmation whether or not the
preceding command was &lt;TAB&gt;.

     <p>This behavior is used by most commands that read file names, like
<kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, and commands that read buffer names, like <kbd>C-x b</kbd>. 
</ul>
