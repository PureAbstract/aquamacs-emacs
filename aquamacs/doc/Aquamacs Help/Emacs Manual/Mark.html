<h2 class="chapter">11 The Mark and the Region</h2>

<p><a name="index-mark-299"></a><a name="index-setting-a-mark-300"></a><a name="index-region-301"></a>
  Many Emacs commands operate on an arbitrary contiguous part of the
current buffer.  To specify the text for such a command to operate on,
you set <dfn>the mark</dfn> at one end of it, and move point to the other
end.  The text between point and the mark is called <dfn>the region</dfn>. 
The region always extends between point and the mark, no matter which
one comes earlier in the text; each time you move point, the region
changes.

   <p>Setting the mark at a position in the text also <dfn>activates</dfn> it. 
When the mark is active, Emacs indicates the extent of the region by
highlighting the text within it, using the <code>region</code> face
(see <a href="Face-Customization.html#Face-Customization">Face Customization</a>).  After certain non-motion commands,
including any command that changes the text in the buffer, Emacs
automatically <dfn>deactivates</dfn> the mark; this turns off the
highlighting.  You can also explicitly deactivate the mark at any
time, by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd> (see <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>).

   <p>This default behavior of the mark is known as Transient Mark mode. 
Disabling Transient Mark mode switches Emacs to an alternative
behavior, in which the mark is always active, which was the default
prior to Emacs 23.  See <a href="Persistent-Mark.html#Persistent-Mark">Persistent Mark</a>.

   <p><a name="index-highlight_002dnonselected_002dwindows-302"></a>  Setting the mark in one buffer has no effect on the marks in other
buffers.  When you return to a buffer with an active mark, the mark is
at the same place as before.  When multiple windows show the same
buffer, they can have different values of point, and thus different
regions, but they all share one common mark position.  See <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>. 
Ordinarily, only the selected window highlights its region; however,
if the variable <code>highlight-nonselected-windows</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, each window highlights its own region.
