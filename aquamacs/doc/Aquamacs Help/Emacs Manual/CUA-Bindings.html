<h3 class="section">12.6 CUA Bindings</h3>

<p><a name="index-cua_002dmode-496"></a><a name="index-cua_002dmode-497"></a><a name="index-CUA-key-bindings-498"></a><a name="index-cua_002denable_002dcua_002dkeys-499"></a>  The command <kbd>M-x cua-mode</kbd> sets up key bindings that are
compatible with the Common User Access (CUA) system used in many other
applications.

   <p>When CUA mode is enabled, the keys <kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-v</kbd>,
and <kbd>C-z</kbd> invoke commands that cut (kill), copy, paste (yank), and
undo respectively.  The <kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> keys perform cut and
copy only if the region is active.  Otherwise, they still act as
prefix keys, so that standard Emacs commands like <kbd>C-x C-c</kbd> still
work.  Note that this means the variable <code>mark-even-if-inactive</code>
has no effect for <kbd>C-x</kbd> and <kbd>C-c</kbd> (see <a href="Using-Region.html#Using-Region">Using Region</a>).

   <p>To enter an Emacs command like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> while the mark is
active, use one of the following methods: either hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>
together with the prefix key, e.g., <kbd>S-C-x C-f</kbd>, or quickly type
the prefix key twice, e.g., <kbd>C-x C-x C-f</kbd>.

   <p>To disable the overriding of standard Emacs binding by CUA mode,
while retaining the other features of CUA mode described below, set
the variable <code>cua-enable-cua-keys</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>In CUA mode, typed text replaces the active region as in
Delete-Selection mode (see <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>).

   <p><a name="index-rectangle-highlighting-500"></a>  CUA mode provides enhanced rectangle support with visible
rectangle highlighting.  Use <kbd>C-RET</kbd> to start a rectangle,
extend it using the movement commands, and cut or copy it using
<kbd>C-x</kbd> or <kbd>C-c</kbd>.  <kbd>RET</kbd> moves the cursor to the next
(clockwise) corner of the rectangle, so you can easily expand it in
any direction.  Normal text you type is inserted to the left or right
of each line in the rectangle (on the same side as the cursor).

   <p>With CUA you can easily copy text and rectangles into and out of
registers by providing a one-digit numeric prefix to the kill, copy,
and yank commands, e.g., <kbd>C-1 C-c</kbd> copies the region into register
<code>1</code>, and <kbd>C-2 C-v</kbd> yanks the contents of register <code>2</code>.

   <p><a name="index-global-mark-501"></a>  CUA mode also has a global mark feature which allows easy moving and
copying of text between buffers.  Use <kbd>C-S-SPC</kbd> to toggle the
global mark on and off.  When the global mark is on, all text that you
kill or copy is automatically inserted at the global mark, and text
you type is inserted at the global mark rather than at the current
position.

   <p>For example, to copy words from various buffers into a word list in
a given buffer, set the global mark in the target buffer, then
navigate to each of the words you want in the list, mark it (e.g., with
<kbd>S-M-f</kbd>), copy it to the list with <kbd>C-c</kbd> or <kbd>M-w</kbd>, and
insert a newline after the word in the target list by pressing
&lt;RET&gt;.
