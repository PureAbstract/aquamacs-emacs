<h2 class="chapter">5 Entering Emacs</h2>

<p><a name="index-entering-Emacs-45"></a><a name="index-starting-Emacs-46"></a>
  The usual way to invoke Emacs is with the shell command
<samp><span class="command">emacs</span></samp>.  From a terminal window running in the X Window
System, you can run Emacs in the background with <samp><span class="command">emacs &amp;</span></samp>;
this way, Emacs won't tie up the terminal window, so you can use it to
run other shell commands.

   <p><a name="index-startup-screen-47"></a>  When Emacs starts up, the initial frame displays a special buffer
named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*GNU Emacs*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This <dfn>startup screen</dfn> contains
information about Emacs and <dfn>links</dfn> to common tasks that are
useful for beginning users.  For instance, activating the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Emacs
Tutorial</span></samp>&rsquo; link opens the Emacs tutorial; this does the same thing as
the command <kbd>C-h t</kbd> (<code>help-with-tutorial</code>).  To activate a
link, either move point onto it and type <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, or click on
it with <kbd>mouse-1</kbd> (the left mouse button).

   <p>Using a command line argument, you can tell Emacs to visit one or
more files as soon as it starts up.  For example, <samp><span class="command">emacs
foo.txt</span></samp> starts Emacs with a buffer displaying the contents of the
file &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.txt</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This feature exists mainly for compatibility
with other editors, which are designed to be launched from the shell
for short editing sessions.  If you call Emacs this way, the initial
frame is split into two windows&mdash;one showing the specified file, and
the other showing the startup screen.  See <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p>Generally, it is unnecessary and wasteful to start Emacs afresh each
time you want to edit a file.  The recommended way to use Emacs is to
start it just once, just after you log in, and do all your editing in
the same Emacs session.  See <a href="Files.html#Files">Files</a>, for information on visiting
more than one file.  If you use Emacs this way, the Emacs session
accumulates valuable context, such as the kill ring, registers, undo
history, and mark ring data, which together make editing more
convenient.  These features are described later in the manual.

   <p>To edit a file from another program while Emacs is running, you can
use the <samp><span class="command">emacsclient</span></samp> helper program to open a file in the
existing Emacs session.  See <a href="Emacs-Server.html#Emacs-Server">Emacs Server</a>.

   <p>Emacs accepts other command line arguments that tell it to load
certain Lisp files, where to put the initial frame, and so forth. 
See <a href="Emacs-Invocation.html#Emacs-Invocation">Emacs Invocation</a>.

   <p><a name="index-inhibit_002dstartup_002dscreen-48"></a>  If the variable <code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
Emacs does not display the startup screen.  In that case, if one or
more files were specified on the command line, Emacs simply displays
those files; otherwise, it displays a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>,
which can be used to evaluate Emacs Lisp expressions interactively. 
See <a href="Lisp-Interaction.html#Lisp-Interaction">Lisp Interaction</a>.  You can set the variable
<code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> using the Customize facility
(see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or by editing your initialization file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>You can also force Emacs to display a file or directory at startup
by setting the variable <code>initial-buffer-choice</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value.  (In that case, even if you specify one or more
files on the command line, Emacs opens but does not display them.) 
The value of <code>initial-buffer-choice</code> should be the name of
the desired file or directory.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Setting <code>inhibit-startup-screen</code> in
<samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> doesn't work, because the startup screen is set
up before reading <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>.  See <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>, for
information about <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp>.</p>
