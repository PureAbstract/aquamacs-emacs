  Deletion means erasing text and not saving it in the kill ring.  For
the most part, the Emacs commands that delete text are those that
erase just one character or only whitespace.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;Backspace&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete the previous character, or the text in the region if it is
active (<code>delete-backward-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;Delete&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete the next character, or the text in the region if it is active
(<code>delete-forward-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-d</kbd><dd>Delete the next character (<code>delete-char</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>M-\</kbd><dd>Delete spaces and tabs around point (<code>delete-horizontal-space</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd><dd>Delete spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space
(<code>just-one-space</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-o</kbd><dd>Delete blank lines around the current line (<code>delete-blank-lines</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-^</kbd><dd>Join two lines by deleting the intervening newline, along with any
indentation following it (<code>delete-indentation</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>We have already described the basic deletion commands &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>delete-backward-char</code>), &lt;delete&gt;
(<code>delete-forward-char</code>), and <kbd>C-d</kbd> (<code>delete-char</code>). 
See <a href="Erasing.html#Erasing">Erasing</a>.  With a numeric argument, they delete the specified
number of characters.  If the numeric argument is omitted or one, they
delete all the text in the region if it is active (see <a href="Using-Region.html#Using-Region">Using Region</a>).

<!-- FIXME: `cycle-spacing' should be documented, too.  (Maybe not in -->
<!-- this node, tho.)  -xfq -->
   <p><a name="index-M_002d_005c-406"></a><a name="index-delete_002dhorizontal_002dspace-407"></a><a name="index-M_002dSPC-408"></a><a name="index-just_002done_002dspace-409"></a>  The other delete commands are those that delete only whitespace
characters: spaces, tabs and newlines.  <kbd>M-\</kbd>
(<code>delete-horizontal-space</code>) deletes all the spaces and tab
characters before and after point.  With a prefix argument, this only
deletes spaces and tab characters before point.  <kbd>M-&lt;SPC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>just-one-space</code>) does likewise but leaves a single space before
point, regardless of the number of spaces that existed previously
(even if there were none before).  With a numeric argument <var>n</var>, it
leaves <var>n</var> spaces before point if <var>n</var> is positive; if <var>n</var>
is negative, it deletes newlines in addition to spaces and tabs,
leaving <var>-n</var> spaces before point.

   <p><kbd>C-x C-o</kbd> (<code>delete-blank-lines</code>) deletes all blank lines
after the current line.  If the current line is blank, it deletes all
blank lines preceding the current line as well (leaving one blank line,
the current line).  On a solitary blank line, it deletes that line.

   <p><kbd>M-^</kbd> (<code>delete-indentation</code>) joins the current line and the
previous line, by deleting a newline and all surrounding spaces, usually
leaving a single space.  See <a href="Indentation.html#Indentation">M-^</a>.
