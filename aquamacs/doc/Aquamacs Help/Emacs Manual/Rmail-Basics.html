<h3 class="section">33.1 Basic Concepts of Rmail</h3>

<p><a name="index-primary-Rmail-file-3652"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dfile_002dname-3653"></a>  Using Rmail in the simplest fashion, you have one Rmail file
<samp><span class="file">~/RMAIL</span></samp> in which all of your mail is saved.  It is called your
<dfn>primary Rmail file</dfn>.  The command <kbd>M-x rmail</kbd> reads your primary
Rmail file, merges new mail in from your inboxes, displays the first
message you haven't read yet, and lets you begin reading.  The variable
<code>rmail-file-name</code> specifies the name of the primary Rmail file.

   <p>Rmail displays only one message in the Rmail file at a time. 
The message that is shown is called the <dfn>current message</dfn>.  Rmail
mode's special commands can do such things as delete the current
message, copy it into another file, send a reply, or move to another
message.  You can also create multiple Rmail files and use Rmail to move
messages between them.

   <p><a name="index-message-number-3654"></a>  Within the Rmail file, messages are normally arranged sequentially in
order of receipt; you can specify other ways to sort them (see <a href="Rmail-Sorting.html#Rmail-Sorting">Rmail Sorting</a>).  Messages are identified by consecutive integers which are
their <dfn>message numbers</dfn>.  The number of the current message is
displayed in Rmail's mode line, followed by the total number of messages
in the file.  You can move to a message by specifying its message number
with the <kbd>j</kbd> key (see <a href="Rmail-Motion.html#Rmail-Motion">Rmail Motion</a>).

   <p><a name="index-s-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3655"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dexpunge_002dand_002dsave-3656"></a>  Following the usual conventions of Emacs, changes in an Rmail file
become permanent only when you save the file.  You can save it with
<kbd>s</kbd> (<code>rmail-expunge-and-save</code>), which also expunges deleted
messages from the file first (see <a href="Rmail-Deletion.html#Rmail-Deletion">Rmail Deletion</a>).  To save the
file without expunging, use <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>.  Rmail also saves the Rmail
file after merging new mail from an inbox file (see <a href="Rmail-Inbox.html#Rmail-Inbox">Rmail Inbox</a>).

   <p><a name="index-q-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3657"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dquit-3658"></a><a name="index-b-_0040r_007b_0028Rmail_0029_007d-3659"></a><a name="index-rmail_002dbury-3660"></a>  You can exit Rmail with <kbd>q</kbd> (<code>rmail-quit</code>); this expunges
and saves the Rmail file, then buries the Rmail buffer as well as its
summary buffer, if present (see <a href="Rmail-Summary.html#Rmail-Summary">Rmail Summary</a>).  But there is no
need to &ldquo;exit&rdquo; formally.  If you switch from Rmail to editing in
other buffers, and never switch back, you have exited.  Just make sure
to save the Rmail file eventually (like any other file you have
changed).  <kbd>C-x s</kbd> is a suitable way to do this (see <a href="Save-Commands.html#Save-Commands">Save Commands</a>).  The Rmail command <kbd>b</kbd>, <code>rmail-bury</code>, buries the
Rmail buffer and its summary without expunging and saving the Rmail file.
