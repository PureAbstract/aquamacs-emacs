<h3 class="section">25.3 Paragraphs</h3>

<p><a name="index-paragraphs-1809"></a><a name="index-manipulating-paragraphs-1810"></a>
  The Emacs commands for manipulating paragraphs are also on Meta keys.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-{</kbd><dd>Move back to previous paragraph beginning (<code>backward-paragraph</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-}</kbd><dd>Move forward to next paragraph end (<code>forward-paragraph</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-h</kbd><dd>Put point and mark around this or next paragraph (<code>mark-paragraph</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-M_002d_0040_007b-1811"></a><a name="index-M_002d_0040_007d-1812"></a><a name="index-backward_002dparagraph-1813"></a><a name="index-forward_002dparagraph-1814"></a>  <kbd>M-{</kbd> (<code>backward-paragraph</code>) moves to the beginning of the
current or previous paragraph (see below for the definition of a
paragraph).  <kbd>M-}</kbd> (<code>forward-paragraph</code>) moves to the end of
the current or next paragraph.  If there is a blank line before the
paragraph, <kbd>M-{</kbd> moves to the blank line.

   <p><a name="index-M_002dh-1815"></a><a name="index-mark_002dparagraph-1816"></a>  When you wish to operate on a paragraph, type <kbd>M-h</kbd>
(<code>mark-paragraph</code>) to set the region around it.  For example,
<kbd>M-h C-w</kbd> kills the paragraph around or after point.  <kbd>M-h</kbd>
puts point at the beginning and mark at the end of the paragraph point
was in.  If point is between paragraphs (in a run of blank lines, or
at a boundary), <kbd>M-h</kbd> sets the region around the paragraph
following point.  If there are blank lines preceding the first line of
the paragraph, one of these blank lines is included in the region.  If
the region is already active, the command sets the mark without
changing point, and each subsequent <kbd>M-h</kbd> further advances the
mark by one paragraph.

   <p>The definition of a paragraph depends on the major mode.  In
Fundamental mode, as well as Text mode and related modes, a paragraph
is separated each neighboring paragraph another by one or more
<dfn>blank lines</dfn>&mdash;lines that are either empty, or consist solely of
space, tab and/or formfeed characters.  In programming language modes,
paragraphs are usually defined in a similar way, so that you can use
the paragraph commands even though there are no paragraphs as such in
a program.

   <p>Note that an indented line is <em>not</em> itself a paragraph break in
Text mode.  If you want indented lines to separate paragraphs, use
Paragraph-Indent Text mode instead.  See <a href="Text-Mode.html#Text-Mode">Text Mode</a>.

   <p>If you set a fill prefix, then paragraphs are delimited by all lines
which don't start with the fill prefix.  See <a href="Filling.html#Filling">Filling</a>.

   <p><a name="index-paragraph_002dstart-1817"></a><a name="index-paragraph_002dseparate-1818"></a>  The precise definition of a paragraph boundary is controlled by the
variables <code>paragraph-separate</code> and <code>paragraph-start</code>.  The
value of <code>paragraph-start</code> is a regular expression that should
match lines that either start or separate paragraphs
(see <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>).  The value of <code>paragraph-separate</code> is another
regular expression that should match lines that separate paragraphs
without being part of any paragraph (for example, blank lines).  Lines
that start a new paragraph and are contained in it must match only
<code>paragraph-start</code>, not <code>paragraph-separate</code>.  For example,
in Fundamental mode, <code>paragraph-start</code> is <code>"\f\\|[&nbsp;\t]*$"</code><!-- /@w -->, and <code>paragraph-separate</code> is <code>"[&nbsp;\t\f]*$"</code><!-- /@w -->.
