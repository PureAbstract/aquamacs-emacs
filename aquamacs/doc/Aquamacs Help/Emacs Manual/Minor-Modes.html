<h3 class="section">23.2 Minor Modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-minor-modes-1724"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-minor-1725"></a>
  A minor mode is an optional editing mode that alters the behavior of
Emacs in some well-defined way.  Unlike major modes, any number of
minor modes can be in effect at any time.  Some minor modes are
<dfn>buffer-local</dfn>, and can be turned on (enabled) in certain buffers
and off (disabled) in others.  Other minor modes are <dfn>global</dfn>:
while enabled, they affect everything you do in the Emacs session, in
all buffers.  Most minor modes are disabled by default, but a few are
enabled by default.

   <p>Most buffer-local minor modes say in the mode line when they are
enabled, just after the major mode indicator.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Fill</span></samp>&rsquo; in the mode line means that Auto Fill mode is enabled. 
See <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.

   <p><a name="index-mode-commands-for-minor-modes-1726"></a>  Like major modes, each minor mode is associated with a <dfn>mode
command</dfn>, whose name consists of the mode name followed by
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For instance, the mode command for Auto Fill mode is
<code>auto-fill-mode</code>.  But unlike a major mode command, which simply
enables the mode, the mode command for a minor mode can either enable
or disable it:

     <ul>
<li>If you invoke the mode command directly with no prefix argument
(either via <kbd>M-x</kbd>, or by binding it to a key and typing that key;
see <a href="Key-Bindings.html#Key-Bindings">Key Bindings</a>), that <dfn>toggles</dfn> the minor mode.  The minor
mode is turned on if it was off, and turned off if it was on.

     <li>If you invoke the mode command with a prefix argument, the minor mode
is unconditionally turned off if that argument is zero or negative;
otherwise, it is unconditionally turned on.

     <li>If the mode command is called via Lisp, the minor mode is
unconditionally turned on if the argument is omitted or <code>nil</code>. 
This makes it easy to turn on a minor mode from a major mode's mode
hook (see <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).  A non-<code>nil</code> argument is handled like
an interactive prefix argument, as described above. 
</ul>

   <p>Most minor modes also have a <dfn>mode variable</dfn>, with the same name
as the mode command.  Its value is non-<code>nil</code> if the mode is
enabled, and <code>nil</code> if it is disabled.  In general, you should not
try to enable or disable the mode by changing the value of the mode
variable directly in Lisp; you should run the mode command instead. 
However, setting the mode variable through the Customize interface
(see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>) will always properly enable or disable
the mode, since Customize automatically runs the mode command for you.

   <p>The following is a list of some buffer-local minor modes:

     <ul>
<li>Abbrev mode automatically expands text based on pre-defined
abbreviation definitions.  See <a href="Abbrevs.html#Abbrevs">Abbrevs</a>.

     <li>Auto Fill mode inserts newlines as you type to prevent lines from
becoming too long.  See <a href="Filling.html#Filling">Filling</a>.

     <li>Auto Save mode saves the buffer contents periodically to reduce the
amount of work you can lose in case of a crash.  See <a href="Auto-Save.html#Auto-Save">Auto Save</a>.

     <li>Enriched mode enables editing and saving of formatted text. 
See <a href="Enriched-Text.html#Enriched-Text">Enriched Text</a>.

     <li>Flyspell mode automatically highlights misspelled words. 
See <a href="Spelling.html#Spelling">Spelling</a>.

     <li>Font-Lock mode automatically highlights certain textual units found in
programs.  It is enabled globally by default, but you can disable it
in individual buffers.  See <a href="Faces.html#Faces">Faces</a>.

     <p><a name="index-linum_002dmode-1727"></a><a name="index-Linum-mode-1728"></a><li>Linum mode displays each line's line number in the window's left margin.

     <li>Outline minor mode provides similar facilities to the major mode
called Outline mode.  See <a href="Outline-Mode.html#Outline-Mode">Outline Mode</a>.

     <p><a name="index-Overwrite-mode-1729"></a><a name="index-mode_002c-Overwrite-1730"></a><a name="index-overwrite_002dmode-1731"></a><a name="index-INSERT-1732"></a><li>Overwrite mode causes ordinary printing characters to replace existing
text instead of shoving it to the right.  For example, if point is in
front of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOBAR</span></samp>&rsquo;, then in Overwrite mode typing
a <kbd>G</kbd> changes it to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOGAR</span></samp>&rsquo;, instead of producing
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FOOGBAR</span></samp>&rsquo; as usual.  In Overwrite mode, the command <kbd>C-q</kbd>
inserts the next character whatever it may be, even if it is a
digit&mdash;this gives you a way to insert a character instead of
replacing an existing character.  The mode command,
<code>overwrite-mode</code>, is bound to the &lt;Insert&gt; key.

     <p><a name="index-binary_002doverwrite_002dmode-1733"></a><li>Binary Overwrite mode is a variant of Overwrite mode for editing
binary files; it treats newlines and tabs like other characters, so
that they overwrite other characters and can be overwritten by them. 
In Binary Overwrite mode, digits after <kbd>C-q</kbd> specify an octal
character code, as usual.

     <li>Visual Line mode performs &ldquo;word wrapping&rdquo;, causing long lines to be
wrapped at word boundaries.  See <a href="Visual-Line-Mode.html#Visual-Line-Mode">Visual Line Mode</a>. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">And here are some useful global minor modes:

     <ul>
<li>Column Number mode enables display of the current column number in the
mode line.  See <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.

     <li>Delete Selection mode causes text insertion to first delete the text
in the region, if the region is active.  See <a href="Using-Region.html#Using-Region">Using Region</a>.

     <li>Icomplete mode displays an indication of available completions when
you are in the minibuffer and completion is active.  See <a href="Completion-Options.html#Completion-Options">Completion Options</a>.

     <li>Line Number mode enables display of the current line number in the
mode line.  It is enabled by default.  See <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>.

     <li>Menu Bar mode gives each frame a menu bar.  It is enabled by default. 
See <a href="Menu-Bars.html#Menu-Bars">Menu Bars</a>.

     <li>Scroll Bar mode gives each window a scroll bar.  It is enabled by
default, but the scroll bar is only displayed on graphical terminals. 
See <a href="Scroll-Bars.html#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>.

     <li>Tool Bar mode gives each frame a tool bar.  It is enabled by default,
but the tool bar is only displayed on graphical terminals.  See <a href="Tool-Bars.html#Tool-Bars">Tool Bars</a>.

     <li>Transient Mark mode highlights the region, and makes many Emacs
commands operate on the region when the mark is active.  It is enabled
by default.  See <a href="Mark.html#Mark">Mark</a>. 
</ul>
