<h4 class="subsection">48.2.5 Per-Directory Local Variables</h4>

<p><a name="index-local-variables_002c-for-all-files-in-a-directory-4394"></a><a name="index-directory_002dlocal-variables-4395"></a><a name="index-per_002ddirectory-local-variables-4396"></a>
  Sometimes, you may wish to define the same set of local variables to
all the files in a certain directory and its subdirectories, such as
the directory tree of a large software project.  This can be
accomplished with <dfn>directory-local variables</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002edir_002dlocals_002eel_007d-file-4397"></a>  The usual way to define directory-local variables is to put a file
named <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> in a
directory.  Whenever Emacs visits any file in that directory or any of
its subdirectories, it will apply the directory-local variables
specified in <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp>, as though they had been defined as
file-local variables for that file (see <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).  Emacs
searches for <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> starting in the directory of the
visited file, and moving up the directory tree.  To avoid slowdown,
this search is skipped for remote files.  If needed, the search can be
extended for remote files by setting the variable
<code>enable-remote-dir-locals</code> to <code>t</code>.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file should hold a specially-constructed
list, which maps major mode names (symbols) to alists
(see <a href="../elisp/Association-Lists.html#Association-Lists">Association Lists</a>). 
Each alist entry consists of a variable name and the directory-local
value to assign to that variable, when the specified major mode is
enabled.  Instead of a mode name, you can specify &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nil</span></samp>&rsquo;, which
means that the alist applies to any mode; or you can specify a
subdirectory name (a string), in which case the alist applies to all
files in that subdirectory.

   <p>Here's an example of a <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file:

<pre class="example">     ((nil . ((indent-tabs-mode . t)
              (fill-column . 80)))
      (c-mode . ((c-file-style . "BSD")
                 (subdirs . nil)))
      ("src/imported"
       . ((nil . ((change-log-default-name
                   . "ChangeLog.local"))))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This sets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">indent-tabs-mode</span></samp>&rsquo; and <code>fill-column</code> for any file
in the directory tree, and the indentation style for any C source
file.  The special <code>subdirs</code> element is not a variable, but a
special keyword which indicates that the C mode settings are only to
be applied in the current directory, not in any subdirectories. 
Finally, it specifies a different <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> file name for any
file in the <samp><span class="file">src/imported</span></samp> subdirectory.

   <p><a name="index-add_002ddir_002dlocal_002dvariable-4398"></a><a name="index-delete_002ddir_002dlocal_002dvariable-4399"></a><a name="index-copy_002dfile_002dlocals_002dto_002ddir_002dlocals-4400"></a>  Instead of editing the <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file by hand, you can
use the command <kbd>M-x add-dir-local-variable</kbd>.  This prompts for a
mode or subdirectory name, and for variable and value, and adds the
entry defining the directory-local variable.  <kbd>M-x
delete-dir-local-variable</kbd> deletes an entry.  <kbd>M-x
copy-file-locals-to-dir-locals</kbd> copies the file-local variables in the
current file into <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dset_002dclass_002dvariables-4401"></a><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dset_002ddirectory_002dclass-4402"></a>  Another method of specifying directory-local variables is to define
a group of variables/value pairs in a <dfn>directory class</dfn>, using the
<code>dir-locals-set-class-variables</code> function; then, tell Emacs which
directories correspond to the class by using the
<code>dir-locals-set-directory-class</code> function.  These function calls
normally go in your initialization file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  This
method is useful when you can't put <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> in a
directory for some reason.  For example, you could apply settings to
an unwritable directory this way:

<pre class="example">     (dir-locals-set-class-variables 'unwritable-directory
        '((nil . ((some-useful-setting . value)))))
     
     (dir-locals-set-directory-class
        "/usr/include/" 'unwritable-directory)
</pre>
   <p>If a variable has both a directory-local and file-local value
specified, the file-local value takes effect.  Unsafe directory-local
variables are handled in the same way as unsafe file-local variables
(see <a href="Safe-File-Variables.html#Safe-File-Variables">Safe File Variables</a>).

   <p>Directory-local variables also take effect in certain buffers that
do not visit a file directly but perform work within a directory, such
as Dired buffers (see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>).

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small>  On MS-DOS, the name of this file
should be <samp><span class="file">_dir-locals.el</span></samp>, due to limitations of the DOS
filesystems.  If the filesystem is limited to 8+3 file names, the name
of the file will be truncated by the OS to <samp><span class="file">_dir-loc.el</span></samp>. </p>
