<h5 class="subsubsection">31.6.5.8 Stopping and Starting Multi-threaded Programs</h5>

<p><a name="index-Multithreaded-debugging-in-GDB-2411"></a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">All-stop Debugging</h5>

<p>In all-stop mode, whenever your program stops, <em>all</em> threads of
execution stop.  Likewise, whenever you restart the program, all
threads start executing.  See <a href="../gdb/All_002dStop-Mode.html#All_002dStop-Mode">All-Stop Mode</a>.  You can enable this behaviour in Emacs by setting
<code>gdb-non-stop-setting</code> to <code>nil</code> before starting a debugging
session.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Non-stop Debugging</h5>

<p><a name="index-Non_002dstop-debugging-in-GDB-2412"></a>
For some multi-threaded targets, GDB supports a further mode of
operation in which you can examine stopped program threads in the
debugger while other threads continue to execute freely. 
See <a href="../gdb/Non_002dStop-Mode.html#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>. 
This is referred to as <dfn>non-stop</dfn> mode.

   <p>Versions of GDB prior to 7.0 do not support non-stop mode and it does
not work on all targets.  In such cases, Emacs uses all-stop mode
regardless of the value of <code>gdb-non-stop-setting</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dnon_002dstop_002dsetting-2413"></a>If the variable <code>gdb-non-stop-setting</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (the
default value), Emacs tries to start GDB in non-stop mode.  Note that
GDB debugging session needs to be restarted for change of this setting
to take effect.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dswitch_002dwhen_002danother_002dstopped-2414"></a>When a thread stops in non-stop mode, Emacs automatically switches to
that thread.  It may be undesirable to allow switching of current
thread when some other stopped thread is already selected.  Set
<code>gdb-switch-when-another-stopped</code> to <code>nil</code> to prevent this.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dswitch_002dreasons-2415"></a>Emacs can decide whether or not to switch to the stopped thread
depending on the reason which caused the stop.  Customize
<code>gdb-switch-reasons</code> to select stop reasons which make Emacs
switch thread.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dstopped_002dhooks-2416"></a>The variable <code>gdb-stopped-hooks</code> allows you to execute your
functions whenever some thread stops.

   <p>In non-stop mode, you can switch between different modes for GUD
execution control commands.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dgud_002dcontrol_002dall_002dthreads-2417"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><dfn>Non-stop/A</dfn><dd>
When <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code> is <code>t</code> (the default
value), interruption and continuation commands apply to all threads,
so you can halt or continue all your threads with one command using
<code>gud-stop-subjob</code> and <code>gud-cont</code>, respectively.  The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Go</span></samp>&rsquo; button is shown on the toolbar when at least one thread is
stopped, whereas &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Stop</span></samp>&rsquo; button is shown when at least one thread
is running.

     <br><dt><dfn>Non-stop/T</dfn><dd>
When <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code> is <code>nil</code>, only the
current thread is stopped/continued.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Go</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Stop</span></samp>&rsquo;
buttons on the GUD toolbar are shown depending on the state of current
thread. 
</dl>

   <p>You can change the current value of <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code>
from the tool bar or from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GUD-&gt;GDB-MI</span></samp>&rsquo; menu.

   <p>Stepping commands always apply to the current thread.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Fine Thread Control</h5>

<p>In non-stop mode, you can interrupt/continue your threads without
selecting them.  Hitting <kbd>i</kbd> in threads buffer interrupts thread
under point, <kbd>c</kbd> continues it, <kbd>s</kbd> steps through.  More such
commands may be added in the future.

   <p>Combined with creating bound buffers for any thread, this allows you
to change and track state of many threads in the same time.

   <p>Note that when you interrupt a thread, it stops with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">signal
received</span></samp>&rsquo; reason.  If that reason is included in your
<code>gdb-switch-reasons</code> (it is by default), Emacs will switch to
that thread.
