<h5 class="subsubsection">27.6.5.8 Multithreaded Debugging</h5>

<p><a name="index-Multithreaded-debugging-in-GDB-2684"></a><a name="index-Non_002dstop-debugging-in-GDB-2685"></a>
  In GDB's <dfn>all-stop mode</dfn>, whenever your program stops, all
execution threads stop.  Likewise, whenever you restart the program,
all threads start executing.  See <a href="../gdb/All_002dStop-Mode.html#All_002dStop-Mode">All-Stop Mode</a>.  For some multi-threaded targets, GDB supports
a further mode of operation, called <dfn>non-stop mode</dfn>, in which you
can examine stopped program threads in the debugger while other
threads continue to execute freely.  See <a href="../gdb/Non_002dStop-Mode.html#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>.  Versions of GDB prior to 7.0 do not
support non-stop mode, and it does not work on all targets.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dnon_002dstop_002dsetting-2686"></a>  The variable <code>gdb-non-stop-setting</code> determines whether Emacs
runs GDB in all-stop mode or non-stop mode.  The default is <code>t</code>,
which means it tries to use non-stop mode if that is available.  If
you change the value to <code>nil</code>, or if non-stop mode is
unavailable, Emacs runs GDB in all-stop mode.  The variable takes
effect when Emacs begins a debugging session; if you change its value,
you should restart any active debugging session.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dswitch_002dwhen_002danother_002dstopped-2687"></a>  When a thread stops in non-stop mode, Emacs usually switches to that
thread.  If you don't want Emacs to do this switch if another stopped
thread is already selected, change the variable
<code>gdb-switch-when-another-stopped</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dswitch_002dreasons-2688"></a>  Emacs can decide whether or not to switch to the stopped thread
depending on the reason which caused the stop.  Customize the variable
<code>gdb-switch-reasons</code> to select the stop reasons which will cause
a thread switch.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dstopped_002dfunctions-2689"></a>  The variable <code>gdb-stopped-functions</code> allows you to execute your
functions whenever some thread stops.

   <p>In non-stop mode, you can switch between different modes for GUD
execution control commands.

   <p><a name="index-gdb_002dgud_002dcontrol_002dall_002dthreads-2690"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><dfn>Non-stop/A</dfn><dd>
  When <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code> is <code>t</code> (the default
value), interruption and continuation commands apply to all threads,
so you can halt or continue all your threads with one command using
<code>gud-stop-subjob</code> and <code>gud-cont</code>, respectively.  The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Go</span></samp>&rsquo; button is shown on the toolbar when at least one thread is
stopped, whereas &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Stop</span></samp>&rsquo; button is shown when at least one thread
is running.

     <br><dt><dfn>Non-stop/T</dfn><dd>
When <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code> is <code>nil</code>, only the
current thread is stopped/continued.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Go</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Stop</span></samp>&rsquo;
buttons on the GUD toolbar are shown depending on the state of current
thread. 
</dl>

   <p>You can change the current value of <code>gdb-gud-control-all-threads</code>
from the tool bar or from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">GUD-&gt;GDB-MI</span></samp>&rsquo; menu.

   <p>Stepping commands always apply to the current thread.

   <p>In non-stop mode, you can interrupt/continue your threads without
selecting them.  Hitting <kbd>i</kbd> in threads buffer interrupts thread
under point, <kbd>c</kbd> continues it, <kbd>s</kbd> steps through.  More such
commands may be added in the future.

   <p>Note that when you interrupt a thread, it stops with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">signal received</span></samp>&rsquo; reason.  If that reason is included in your
<code>gdb-switch-reasons</code> (it is by default), Emacs will switch to
that thread.
