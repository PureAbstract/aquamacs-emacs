<h3 class="section">30.18 Viewing Image Thumbnails in Dired</h3>

<p><a name="index-image_002ddired-mode-3219"></a><a name="index-image_002ddired-3220"></a>
  Image-Dired is a facility for browsing image files.  It provides viewing
the images either as thumbnails or in full size, either inside Emacs
or through an external viewer.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dt-d-_0040r_007b_0028Image_002dDired_0029_007d-3221"></a><a name="index-image_002ddired_002ddisplay_002dthumbs-3222"></a>  To enter Image-Dired, mark the image files you want to look at in
the Dired buffer, using <kbd>m</kbd> as usual.  Then type <kbd>C-t d</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-display-thumbs</code>).  This creates and switches to a
buffer containing image-dired, corresponding to the marked files.

   <p>You can also enter Image-Dired directly by typing <kbd>M-x
image-dired</kbd>.  This prompts for a directory; specify one that has
image files.  This creates thumbnails for all the images in that
directory, and displays them all in the &ldquo;thumbnail buffer&rdquo;.  This
takes a long time if the directory contains many image files, and it
asks for confirmation if the number of image files exceeds
<code>image-dired-show-all-from-dir-max-files</code>.

   <p>With point in the thumbnail buffer, you can type <kbd>RET</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-display-thumbnail-original-image</code>) to display a
sized version of it in another window.  This sizes the image to fit
the window.  Use the arrow keys to move around in the buffer.  For
easy browsing, use <kbd>SPC</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-display-next-thumbnail-original</code>) to advance and
display the next image.  Typing <kbd>DEL</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-display-previous-thumbnail-original</code>) backs up to
the previous thumbnail and displays that instead.

   <p><a name="index-image_002ddired_002dexternal_002dviewer-3223"></a>  To view and the image in its original size, either provide a prefix
argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>) before pressing <kbd>RET</kbd>, or type
<kbd>C-&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>image-dired-thumbnail-display-external</code>) to
display the image in an external viewer.  You must first configure
<code>image-dired-external-viewer</code>.

   <p>You can delete images through Image-Dired also.  Type <kbd>d</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-flag-thumb-original-file</code>) to flag the image file
for deletion in the Dired buffer.  You can also delete the thumbnail
image from the thumbnail buffer with <kbd>C-d</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-delete-char</code>).

   <p>More advanced features include <dfn>image tags</dfn>, which are metadata
used to categorize image files.  The tags are stored in a plain text
file configured by <code>image-dired-db-file</code>.

   <p>To tag image files, mark them in the dired buffer (you can also mark
files in Dired from the thumbnail buffer by typing <kbd>m</kbd>) and type
<kbd>C-t t</kbd> (<code>image-dired-tag-files</code>).  This reads the tag name
in the minibuffer.  To mark files having a certain tag, type <kbd>C-t f</kbd>
(<code>image-dired-mark-tagged-files</code>).  After marking image files
with a certain tag, you can use <kbd>C-t d</kbd> to view them.

   <p>You can also tag a file directly from the thumbnail buffer by typing
<kbd>t t</kbd> and you can remove a tag by typing <kbd>t r</kbd>.  There is also
a special &ldquo;tag&rdquo; called &ldquo;comment&rdquo; for each file (it is not a tag in
the exact same sense as the other tags, it is handled slightly
different).  That is used to enter a comment or description about the
image.  You comment a file from the thumbnail buffer by typing
<kbd>c</kbd>.  You will be prompted for a comment.  Type <kbd>C-t c</kbd> to add
a comment from Dired (<code>image-dired-dired-comment-files</code>).

   <p>Image-Dired also provides simple image manipulation.  In the
thumbnail buffer, type <kbd>L</kbd> to rotate the original image 90 degrees
anti clockwise, and <kbd>R</kbd> to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.  This
rotation is lossless, and uses an external utility called JpegTRAN.
