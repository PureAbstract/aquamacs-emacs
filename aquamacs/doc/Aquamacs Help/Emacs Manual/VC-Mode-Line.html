<h4 class="subsection">28.1.2 Version Control and the Mode Line</h4>

<p><a name="index-VC-mode-line-indicator-2767"></a>
  When you visit a file that is under version control, Emacs indicates
this on the mode line.  For example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Bzr-1223</span></samp>&rsquo; says that Bazaar
is used for that file, and the current revision ID is 1223.

   <p><a name="index-version-control-status-2768"></a>  The character between the back-end name and the revision ID
indicates the <dfn>version control status</dfn> of the work file.  In a
merge-based version control system, a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; character indicates
that the work file is unmodified, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates that it has
been modified.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates that the file contains conflicts as
result of a recent merge operation (see <a href="Merging.html#Merging">Merging</a>), or that the file
was removed from the version control.  Finally, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; means that
the file is under version control, but is missing from the working
tree.

   <p>In a lock-based system, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates an unlocked file, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; a locked file; if the file is locked by another user (for
instance, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">jim</span></samp>&rsquo;), that is displayed as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RCS:jim:1.3</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; means that the file was locally added, but not yet committed
to the master repository.

   <p>On a graphical display, you can move the mouse over this mode line
indicator to pop up a &ldquo;tool-tip&rdquo;, which displays a more verbose
description of the version control status.  Pressing <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>
over the indicator pops up a menu of VC commands, identical to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Tools / Version Control</span></samp>&rsquo; on the menu bar.

   <p><a name="index-auto_002drevert_002dcheck_002dvc_002dinfo-2769"></a>  When Auto Revert mode (see <a href="Reverting.html#Reverting">Reverting</a>) reverts a buffer that is
under version control, it updates the version control information in
the mode line.  However, Auto Revert mode may not properly update this
information if the version control status changes without changes to
the work file, from outside the current Emacs session.  If you set
<code>auto-revert-check-vc-info</code> to <code>t</code>, Auto Revert mode updates
the version control status information every
<code>auto-revert-interval</code> seconds, even if the work file itself is
unchanged.  The resulting CPU usage depends on the version control
system, but is usually not excessive.
