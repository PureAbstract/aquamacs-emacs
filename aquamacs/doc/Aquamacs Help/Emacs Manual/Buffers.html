<h2 class="chapter">19 Using Multiple Buffers</h2>

<p><a name="index-buffers-1263"></a>  The text you are editing in Emacs resides in an object called a
<dfn>buffer</dfn>.  Each time you visit a file, a buffer is used to hold
the file's text.  Each time you invoke Dired, a buffer is used to hold
the directory listing.  If you send a message with <kbd>C-x m</kbd>, a
buffer is used to hold the text of the message.  When you ask for a
command's documentation, that appears in a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*Help*</span></samp>.

   <p>Each buffer has a unique name, which can be of any length.  When a
buffer is displayed in a window, its name is shown in the mode line
(see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).  The distinction between upper and lower case
matters in buffer names.  Most buffers are made by visiting files, and
their names are derived from the files' names; however, you can also
create an empty buffer with any name you want.  A newly started Emacs
has several buffers, including one named <samp><span class="file">*scratch*</span></samp>, which can
be used for evaluating Lisp expressions and is not associated with any
file (see <a href="Lisp-Interaction.html#Lisp-Interaction">Lisp Interaction</a>).

   <p><a name="index-selected-buffer-1264"></a><a name="index-current-buffer-1265"></a>  At any time, one and only one buffer is <dfn>selected</dfn>; we call it
the <dfn>current buffer</dfn>.  We sometimes say that a command operates on
&ldquo;the buffer&rdquo;; this really means that it operates on the current
buffer.  When there is only one Emacs window, the buffer displayed in
that window is current.  When there are multiple windows, the buffer
displayed in the <dfn>selected window</dfn> is current.  See <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p>Aside from its textual contents, each buffer records several pieces
of information, such as what file it is visiting (if any), whether it
is modified, and what major mode and minor modes are in effect
(see <a href="Modes.html#Modes">Modes</a>).  These are stored in <dfn>buffer-local
variables</dfn>&mdash;variables that can have a different value in each buffer. 
See <a href="Locals.html#Locals">Locals</a>.

   <p><a name="index-buffer-size_002c-maximum-1266"></a>  A buffer's size cannot be larger than some maximum, which is defined
by the largest buffer position representable by <dfn>Emacs integers</dfn>. 
This is because Emacs tracks buffer positions using that data type. 
For typical 64-bit machines, this maximum buffer size is 2^61 -
2 bytes, or about 2 EiB.  For typical 32-bit machines, the maximum is
usually 2^29 - 2 bytes, or about 512 MiB.  Buffer sizes are
also limited by the amount of memory in the system.
