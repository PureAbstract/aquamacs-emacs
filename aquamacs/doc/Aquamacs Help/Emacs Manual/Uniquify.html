<h4 class="subsection">19.7.1 Making Buffer Names Unique</h4>

<p><a name="index-unique-buffer-names-1351"></a><a name="index-directories-in-buffer-names-1352"></a>  When several buffers visit identically-named files, Emacs must give
the buffers distinct names.  The usual method for making buffer names
unique adds &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;2&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;3&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc. to the end of the buffer
names (all but one of them).

   <p><a name="index-uniquify_002dbuffer_002dname_002dstyle-1353"></a>  Other methods work by adding parts of each file's directory to the
buffer name.  To select one, load the library <samp><span class="file">uniquify</span></samp> (e.g.,
using <code>(require 'uniquify)</code>), and customize the variable
<code>uniquify-buffer-name-style</code> (see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>).

   <p>To begin with, the <code>forward</code> naming method includes part of the
file's directory name at the beginning of the buffer name; using this
method, buffers visiting the files <samp><span class="file">/u/rms/tmp/Makefile</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/usr/projects/zaphod/Makefile</span></samp> would be named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tmp/Makefile</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">zaphod/Makefile</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively (instead
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile&lt;2&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;).

   <p>In contrast, the <code>post-forward</code> naming method would call the
buffers &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile|tmp</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile|zaphod</span></samp>&rsquo;, and the
<code>reverse</code> naming method would call them &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile\tmp</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Makefile\zaphod</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The nontrivial difference between
<code>post-forward</code> and <code>reverse</code> occurs when just one directory
name is not enough to distinguish two files; then <code>reverse</code> puts
the directory names in reverse order, so that <samp><span class="file">/top/middle/file</span></samp>
becomes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file\middle\top</span></samp>&rsquo;, while <code>post-forward</code> puts them in
forward order after the file name, as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file|top/middle</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Which rule to follow for putting the directory names in the buffer
name is not very important if you are going to <em>look</em> at the
buffer names before you type one.  But as an experienced user, if you
know the rule, you won't have to look.  And then you may find that one
rule or another is easier for you to remember and apply quickly.
