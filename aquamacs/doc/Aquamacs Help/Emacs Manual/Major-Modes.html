  Every buffer possesses a major mode, which determines the editing
behavior of Emacs while that buffer is current.  The mode line
normally shows the name of the current major mode, in parentheses
(see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).

   <p>The least specialized major mode is called <dfn>Fundamental mode</dfn>. 
This mode has no mode-specific redefinitions or variable settings, so
that each Emacs command behaves in its most general manner, and each
user option variable is in its default state.

   <p>For editing text of a specific type that Emacs knows about, such as
Lisp code or English text, you typically use a more specialized major
mode, such as Lisp mode or Text mode.  Most major modes fall into
three major groups.  The first group contains modes for normal text,
either plain or with mark-up.  It includes Text mode, HTML mode, SGML
mode, TeX mode and Outline mode.  The second group contains modes
for specific programming languages.  These include Lisp mode (which
has several variants), C mode, Fortran mode, and others.  The third
group consists of major modes that are not associated directly with
files; they are used in buffers created for specific purposes by
Emacs, such as Dired mode for buffers made by Dired (see <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>),
Message mode for buffers made by <kbd>C-x m</kbd> (see <a href="Sending-Mail.html#Sending-Mail">Sending Mail</a>),
and Shell mode for buffers used to communicate with an inferior shell
process (see <a href="Interactive-Shell.html#Interactive-Shell">Interactive Shell</a>).

   <p>Usually, the major mode is automatically set by Emacs, when you
first visit a file or create a buffer (see <a href="Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>).  You
can explicitly select a new major mode by using an <kbd>M-x</kbd> command. 
Take the name of the mode and add <code>-mode</code> to get the name of the
command to select that mode (e.g., <kbd>M-x lisp-mode</kbd> enters Lisp mode).

   <p><a name="index-major_002dmode-1718"></a>  The value of the buffer-local variable <code>major-mode</code> is a symbol
with the same name as the major mode command (e.g., <code>lisp-mode</code>). 
This variable is set automatically; you should not change it yourself.

   <p>The default value of <code>major-mode</code> determines the major mode to
use for files that do not specify a major mode, and for new buffers
created with <kbd>C-x b</kbd>.  Normally, this default value is the symbol
<code>fundamental-mode</code>, which specifies Fundamental mode.  You can
change this default value via the Customization interface (see <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization">Easy Customization</a>), or by adding a line like this to your init file
(see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>):

<pre class="example">     (setq-default major-mode 'text-mode)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the default value of <code>major-mode</code> is <code>nil</code>, the major
mode is taken from the previously current buffer.

   <p>Specialized major modes often change the meanings of certain keys to
do something more suitable for the mode.  For instance, programming
language modes bind &lt;TAB&gt; to indent the current line according to
the rules of the language (see <a href="Indentation.html#Indentation">Indentation</a>).  The keys that are
commonly changed are &lt;TAB&gt;, &lt;DEL&gt;, and <kbd>C-j</kbd>.  Many modes
also define special commands of their own, usually bound in the prefix
key <kbd>C-c</kbd>.  Major modes can also alter user options and variables;
for instance, programming language modes typically set a buffer-local
value for the variable <code>comment-start</code>, which determines how
source code comments are delimited (see <a href="Comments.html#Comments">Comments</a>).

   <p><a name="index-describe_002dmode-1719"></a><a name="index-C_002dh-m-1720"></a>  To view the documentation for the current major mode, including a
list of its key bindings, type <code>C-h m</code> (<code>describe-mode</code>).

   <p><a name="index-mode-hook-1721"></a><a name="index-text_002dmode_002dhook-1722"></a><a name="index-prog_002dmode_002dhook-1723"></a>  Every major mode, apart from Fundamental mode, defines a <dfn>mode
hook</dfn>, a customizable list of Lisp functions to run each time the mode
is enabled in a buffer.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>, for more information about
hooks.  Each mode hook is named after its major mode, e.g., Fortran
mode has <code>fortran-mode-hook</code>.  Furthermore, all text-based major
modes run <code>text-mode-hook</code>, and all programming language modes
run <code>prog-mode-hook</code>, prior to running their own mode hooks. 
Hook functions can look at the value of the variable <code>major-mode</code>
to see which mode is actually being entered.

   <p>Mode hooks are commonly used to enable minor modes (see <a href="Minor-Modes.html#Minor-Modes">Minor Modes</a>).  For example, you can put the following lines in your init
file to enable Flyspell minor mode in all text-based major modes
(see <a href="Spelling.html#Spelling">Spelling</a>), and Eldoc minor mode in Emacs Lisp mode
(see <a href="Lisp-Doc.html#Lisp-Doc">Lisp Doc</a>):

     (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'eldoc-mode)
