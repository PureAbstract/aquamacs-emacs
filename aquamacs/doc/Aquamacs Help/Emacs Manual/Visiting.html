   <p><a name="index-files_002c-visiting-and-saving-1016"></a><a name="index-saving-files-1017"></a>  <dfn>Visiting</dfn> a file means reading its contents into an Emacs
buffer so you can edit them.  Emacs makes a new buffer for each file
that you visit.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002df-1018"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile-1019"></a>  To visit a file, type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>) and use the
minibuffer to enter the name of the desired file.  While in the
minibuffer, you can abort the command by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  See <a href="File-Names.html#File-Names">File Names</a>, for details about entering file names into minibuffers.

   <p>If the specified file exists but the system does not allow you to
read it, an error message is displayed in the echo area.  Otherwise,
you can tell that <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> has completed successfully by the
appearance of new text on the screen, and by the buffer name shown in
the mode line (see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).  Emacs normally constructs the
buffer name from the file name, omitting the directory name.  For
example, a file named <samp><span class="file">/usr/rms/emacs.tex</span></samp> is visited in a buffer
named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">emacs.tex</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If there is already a buffer with that name,
Emacs constructs a unique name; the normal method is to append
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;2&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;3&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on, but you can select other methods. 
See <a href="Uniquify.html#Uniquify">Uniquify</a>.

   <p><a name="index-creating-files-1020"></a>  To create a new file, just visit it using the same command, <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd>.  Emacs displays &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(New file)</span></samp>&rsquo; in the echo area, but in other
respects behaves as if you had visited an existing empty file.

   <p><a name="index-modified-_0028buffer_0029-1021"></a>  After visiting a file, the changes you make with editing commands are
made in the Emacs buffer.  They do not take effect in the visited
file, until you <dfn>save</dfn> the buffer (see <a href="Saving.html#Saving">Saving</a>).  If a buffer
contains changes that have not been saved, we say the buffer is
<dfn>modified</dfn>.  This implies that some changes will be lost if the
buffer is not saved.  The mode line displays two stars near the left
margin to indicate that the buffer is modified.

   <p>If you visit a file that is already in Emacs, <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> switches
to the existing buffer instead of making another copy.  Before doing
so, it checks whether the file has changed since you last visited or
saved it.  If the file has changed, Emacs offers to reread it.

   <p><a name="index-large_002dfile_002dwarning_002dthreshold-1022"></a><a name="index-file_002c-warning-when-size-is-large-1023"></a><a name="index-size-of-file_002c-warning-when-visiting-1024"></a><a name="index-maximum-buffer-size-exceeded_002c-error-message-1025"></a>  If you try to visit a file larger than
<code>large-file-warning-threshold</code> (the default is 10000000, which is
about 10 megabytes), Emacs asks you for confirmation first.  You can
answer <kbd>y</kbd> to proceed with visiting the file.  Note, however, that
Emacs cannot visit files that are larger than the maximum Emacs buffer
size, which is limited by the amount of memory Emacs can allocate and
by the integers that Emacs can represent (see <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>).  If you
try, Emacs displays an error message saying that the maximum buffer
size has been exceeded.

   <p><a name="index-wildcard-characters-in-file-names-1026"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dwildcards-1027"></a>  If the file name you specify contains shell-style wildcard
characters, Emacs visits all the files that match it.  (On
case-insensitive filesystems, Emacs matches the wildcards disregarding
the letter case.)  Wildcards include &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo; sequences.  To enter the wild card &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; in a file
name in the minibuffer, you need to type <kbd>C-q ?</kbd>.  See <a href="Quoted-File-Names.html#Quoted-File-Names">Quoted File Names</a>, for information on how to visit a file whose name
actually contains wildcard characters.  You can disable the wildcard
feature by customizing <code>find-file-wildcards</code>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dv-1028"></a><a name="index-find_002dalternate_002dfile-1029"></a>  If you visit the wrong file unintentionally by typing its name
incorrectly, type <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> (<code>find-alternate-file</code>) to visit
the file you really wanted.  <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> is similar to <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd>, but it kills the current buffer (after first offering to save it
if it is modified).  When <kbd>C-x C-v</kbd> reads the file name to visit,
it inserts the entire default file name in the buffer, with point just
after the directory part; this is convenient if you made a slight
error in typing the name.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002drun_002ddired-1030"></a>  If you &ldquo;visit&rdquo; a file that is actually a directory, Emacs invokes
Dired, the Emacs directory browser.  See <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>.  You can disable
this behavior by setting the variable <code>find-file-run-dired</code> to
<code>nil</code>; in that case, it is an error to try to visit a directory.

   <p>Files which are actually collections of other files, or <dfn>file
archives</dfn>, are visited in special modes which invoke a Dired-like
environment to allow operations on archive members.  See <a href="File-Archives.html#File-Archives">File Archives</a>, for more about these features.

   <p>If you visit a file that the operating system won't let you modify,
or that is marked read-only, Emacs makes the buffer read-only too, so
that you won't go ahead and make changes that you'll have trouble
saving afterward.  You can make the buffer writable with <kbd>C-x C-q</kbd>
(<code>read-only-mode</code>).  See <a href="Misc-Buffer.html#Misc-Buffer">Misc Buffer</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002dr-1031"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dread_002donly-1032"></a>  If you want to visit a file as read-only in order to protect
yourself from entering changes accidentally, visit it with the command
<kbd>C-x C-r</kbd> (<code>find-file-read-only</code>) instead of <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-4-f-1033"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dwindow-1034"></a>  <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-window</code>) is like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>
except that the buffer containing the specified file is selected in another
window.  The window that was selected before <kbd>C-x 4 f</kbd> continues to
show the same buffer it was already showing.  If this command is used when
only one window is being displayed, that window is split in two, with one
window showing the same buffer as before, and the other one showing the
newly requested file.  See <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-5-f-1035"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dother_002dframe-1036"></a>  <kbd>C-x 5 f</kbd> (<code>find-file-other-frame</code>) is similar, but opens a
new frame, or selects any existing frame showing the specified file. 
See <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>.

   <p><a name="index-file-selection-dialog-1037"></a>  On graphical displays, there are two additional methods for visiting
files.  Firstly, when Emacs is built with a suitable GUI toolkit,
commands invoked with the mouse (by clicking on the menu bar or tool
bar) use the toolkit's standard &ldquo;File Selection&rdquo; dialog instead of
prompting for the file name in the minibuffer.  On GNU/Linux and Unix
platforms, Emacs does this when built with GTK, LessTif, and Motif
toolkits; on MS-Windows and Mac, the GUI version does that by default. 
For information on how to customize this, see <a href="Dialog-Boxes.html#Dialog-Boxes">Dialog Boxes</a>.

   <p>Secondly, Emacs supports &ldquo;drag and drop&rdquo;: dropping a file into an
ordinary Emacs window visits the file using that window.  As an
exception, dropping a file into a window displaying a Dired buffer
moves or copies the file into the displayed directory.  For details,
see <a href="Drag-and-Drop.html#Drag-and-Drop">Drag and Drop</a>, and <a href="Misc-Dired-Features.html#Misc-Dired-Features">Misc Dired Features</a>.

   <p>On text-mode terminals and on graphical displays when Emacs was
built without a GUI toolkit, you can visit files via the menu-bar
&ldquo;File&rdquo; menu, which has a &ldquo;Visit New File&rdquo; item.

   <p>Each time you visit a file, Emacs automatically scans its contents
to detect what character encoding and end-of-line convention it uses,
and converts these to Emacs's internal encoding and end-of-line
convention within the buffer.  When you save the buffer, Emacs
performs the inverse conversion, writing the file to disk with its
original encoding and end-of-line convention.  See <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dliterally-1038"></a>  If you wish to edit a file as a sequence of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters with no special encoding or conversion, use the <kbd>M-x
find-file-literally</kbd> command.  This visits a file, like <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>,
but does not do format conversion (see <a href="../elisp/Format-Conversion.html#Format-Conversion">Format Conversion</a>), character code
conversion (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>), or automatic uncompression
(see <a href="Compressed-Files.html#Compressed-Files">Compressed Files</a>), and does not add a final newline because
of <code>require-final-newline</code> (see <a href="Customize-Save.html#Customize-Save">Customize Save</a>).  If you have
already visited the same file in the usual (non-literal) manner, this
command asks you whether to visit it literally instead.

   <p><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dhook-1039"></a><a name="index-find_002dfile_002dnot_002dfound_002dfunctions-1040"></a>  Two special hook variables allow extensions to modify the operation
of visiting files.  Visiting a file that does not exist runs the
functions in <code>find-file-not-found-functions</code>; this variable holds
a list of functions, which are called one by one (with no arguments)
until one of them returns non-<code>nil</code>.  This is not a normal hook,
and the name ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-functions</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-hook</span></samp>&rsquo; to
indicate that fact.

   <p>Successful visiting of any file, whether existing or not, calls the
functions in <code>find-file-hook</code>, with no arguments.  This variable
is a normal hook.  In the case of a nonexistent file, the
<code>find-file-not-found-functions</code> are run first.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

   <p>There are several ways to specify automatically the major mode for
editing the file (see <a href="Choosing-Modes.html#Choosing-Modes">Choosing Modes</a>), and to specify local
variables defined for that file (see <a href="File-Variables.html#File-Variables">File Variables</a>).
