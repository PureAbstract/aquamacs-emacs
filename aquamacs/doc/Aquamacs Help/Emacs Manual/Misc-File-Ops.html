<h3 class="section">18.11 Miscellaneous File Operations</h3>

<p>Emacs has commands for performing many other operations on files. 
All operate on one file; they do not accept wildcard file names.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dfile-1171"></a><a name="index-deletion-_0028of-files_0029-1172"></a>  <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> prompts for a file and deletes it.  If you are
deleting many files in one directory, it may be more convenient to use
Dired rather than <code>delete-file</code>.  See <a href="Dired-Deletion.html#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>.

   <p><a name="index-trash-1173"></a><a name="index-recycle-bin-1174"></a>  <kbd>M-x move-file-to-trash</kbd> moves a file into the system
<dfn>Trash</dfn> (or <dfn>Recycle Bin</dfn>).  This is a facility available on
most operating systems; files that are moved into the Trash can be
brought back later if you change your mind.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dby_002dmoving_002dto_002dtrash-1175"></a>  By default, Emacs deletion commands do <em>not</em> use the Trash.  To
use the Trash (when it is available) for common deletion commands,
change the variable <code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code> to <code>t</code>. 
This affects the commands <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> and <kbd>M-x
delete-directory</kbd> (see <a href="Directories.html#Directories">Directories</a>), as well as the deletion
commands in Dired (see <a href="Dired-Deletion.html#Dired-Deletion">Dired Deletion</a>).  Supplying a prefix
argument to <kbd>M-x delete-file</kbd> or <kbd>M-x delete-directory</kbd> makes
them delete outright, instead of using the Trash, regardless of
<code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code>.

   <p>If a file is under version control (see <a href="Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), you
should delete it using <kbd>M-x vc-delete-file</kbd> instead of <kbd>M-x
delete-file</kbd>.  See <a href="VC-Delete_002fRename.html#VC-Delete_002fRename">VC Delete/Rename</a>.

   <p><a name="index-copy_002dfile-1176"></a><a name="index-copying-files-1177"></a>  <kbd>M-x copy-file</kbd> reads the file <var>old</var> and writes a new file
named <var>new</var> with the same contents.

   <p><a name="index-copy_002ddirectory-1178"></a>  <kbd>M-x copy-directory</kbd> copies directories, similar to the
<samp><span class="command">cp -r</span></samp> shell command.  It prompts for a directory <var>old</var>
and a destination <var>new</var>.  If <var>new</var> is an existing directory,
it creates a copy of the <var>old</var> directory and puts it in <var>new</var>. 
If <var>new</var> is not an existing directory, it copies all the contents
of <var>old</var> into a new directory named <var>new</var>.

   <p><a name="index-renaming-files-1179"></a><a name="index-rename_002dfile-1180"></a>  <kbd>M-x rename-file</kbd> reads two file names <var>old</var> and <var>new</var>
using the minibuffer, then renames file <var>old</var> as <var>new</var>.  If
the file name <var>new</var> already exists, you must confirm with
<kbd>yes</kbd> or renaming is not done; this is because renaming causes the
old meaning of the name <var>new</var> to be lost.  If <var>old</var> and
<var>new</var> are on different file systems, the file <var>old</var> is copied
and deleted.  If the argument <var>new</var> is just a directory name, the
real new name is in that directory, with the same non-directory
component as <var>old</var>.  For example, <kbd>M-x rename-file RET ~/foo
RET /tmp RET</kbd> renames <samp><span class="file">~/foo</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">/tmp/foo</span></samp>.  The same rule
applies to all the remaining commands in this section.  All of them
ask for confirmation when the new file name already exists, too.

   <p>If a file is under version control (see <a href="Version-Control.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>), you
should rename it using <kbd>M-x vc-rename-file</kbd> instead of <kbd>M-x
rename-file</kbd>.  See <a href="VC-Delete_002fRename.html#VC-Delete_002fRename">VC Delete/Rename</a>.

   <p><a name="index-add_002dname_002dto_002dfile-1181"></a><a name="index-hard-links-_0028creation_0029-1182"></a>  <kbd>M-x add-name-to-file</kbd> adds an additional name to an existing
file without removing its old name.  The new name is created as a
&ldquo;hard link&rdquo; to the existing file.  The new name must belong on the
same file system that the file is on.  On MS-Windows, this command
works only if the file resides in an NTFS file system.  On MS-DOS, it
works by copying the file.

   <p><a name="index-make_002dsymbolic_002dlink-1183"></a><a name="index-symbolic-links-_0028creation_0029-1184"></a>  <kbd>M-x make-symbolic-link</kbd> reads two file names <var>target</var> and
<var>linkname</var>, then creates a symbolic link named <var>linkname</var>,
which points at <var>target</var>.  The effect is that future attempts to
open file <var>linkname</var> will refer to whatever file is named
<var>target</var> at the time the opening is done, or will get an error if
the name <var>target</var> is nonexistent at that time.  This command does
not expand the argument <var>target</var>, so that it allows you to specify
a relative name as the target of the link.  On MS-Windows, this
command works only on MS Windows Vista and later.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-i-1185"></a><a name="index-insert_002dfile-1186"></a>  <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd> (also <kbd>C-x i</kbd>) inserts a copy of the
contents of the specified file into the current buffer at point,
leaving point unchanged before the contents.  The position after the
inserted contents is added to the mark ring, without activating the
mark (see <a href="Mark-Ring.html#Mark-Ring">Mark Ring</a>).

   <p><a name="index-insert_002dfile_002dliterally-1187"></a>  <kbd>M-x insert-file-literally</kbd> is like <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd>,
except the file is inserted &ldquo;literally&rdquo;: it is treated as a sequence
of <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters with no special encoding or conversion,
similar to the <kbd>M-x find-file-literally</kbd> command
(see <a href="Visiting.html#Visiting">Visiting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-write_002dregion-1188"></a>  <kbd>M-x write-region</kbd> is the inverse of <kbd>M-x insert-file</kbd>; it
copies the contents of the region into the specified file.  <kbd>M-x
append-to-file</kbd> adds the text of the region to the end of the
specified file.  See <a href="Accumulating-Text.html#Accumulating-Text">Accumulating Text</a>.  The variable
<code>write-region-inhibit-fsync</code> applies to these commands, as well
as saving files; see <a href="Customize-Save.html#Customize-Save">Customize Save</a>.

   <p><a name="index-set_002dfile_002dmodes-1189"></a><a name="index-file-modes-1190"></a><a name="index-file-permissions-1191"></a>  <kbd>M-x set-file-modes</kbd> reads a file name followed by a <dfn>file
mode</dfn>, and applies that file mode to the specified file.  File modes,
also called <dfn>file permissions</dfn>, determine whether a file can be
read, written to, or executed, and by whom.  This command reads file
modes using the same symbolic or octal format accepted by the
<samp><span class="command">chmod</span></samp> command; for instance, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">u+x</span></samp>&rsquo; means to add
execution permission for the user who owns the file.  It has no effect
on operating systems that do not support file modes.  <code>chmod</code> is a
convenience alias for this function.
