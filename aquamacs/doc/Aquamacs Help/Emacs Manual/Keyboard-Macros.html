<h2 class="chapter">17 Keyboard Macros</h2>

<p><a name="index-defining-keyboard-macros-956"></a><a name="index-keyboard-macro-957"></a>
  In this chapter we describe how to record a sequence of editing
commands so you can repeat it conveniently later.

   <p>A <dfn>keyboard macro</dfn> is a command defined by an Emacs user to stand for
another sequence of keys.  For example, if you discover that you are
about to type <kbd>C-n M-d C-d</kbd> forty times, you can speed your work by
defining a keyboard macro to do <kbd>C-n M-d C-d</kbd>, and then executing
it 39 more times.

   <p>You define a keyboard macro by executing and recording the commands
which are its definition.  Put differently, as you define a keyboard
macro, the definition is being executed for the first time.  This way,
you can see the effects of your commands, so that you don't have to
figure them out in your head.  When you close the definition, the
keyboard macro is defined and also has been, in effect, executed once. 
You can then do the whole thing over again by invoking the macro.

   <p>Keyboard macros differ from ordinary Emacs commands in that they are
written in the Emacs command language rather than in Lisp.  This makes it
easier for the novice to write them, and makes them more convenient as
temporary hacks.  However, the Emacs command language is not powerful
enough as a programming language to be useful for writing anything
intelligent or general.  For such things, Lisp must be used.
