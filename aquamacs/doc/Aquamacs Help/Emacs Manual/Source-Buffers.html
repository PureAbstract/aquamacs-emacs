     <dl>
<dt><kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> (in fringe)<dd>Set or clear a breakpoint on that line.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-Mouse-1</kbd> (in fringe)<dd>Enable or disable a breakpoint on that line.

     <br><dt><kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> (in fringe)<dd>Continue execution to that line.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-Mouse-3</kbd> (in fringe)<dd>Jump to that line. 
</dl>

   <p>On a graphical display, you can click <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> in the fringe of
a source buffer, to set a breakpoint on that line (see <a href="Fringes.html#Fringes">Fringes</a>). 
A red dot appears in the fringe, where you clicked.  If a breakpoint
already exists there, the click removes it.  A <kbd>C-Mouse-1</kbd> click
enables or disables an existing breakpoint; a breakpoint that is
disabled, but not unset, is indicated by a gray dot.

   <p>On a text terminal, or when fringes are disabled, enabled
breakpoints are indicated with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; character in the left margin
of the window.  Disabled breakpoints are indicated with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(The margin is only displayed if a breakpoint is present.)

   <p>A solid arrow in the left fringe of a source buffer indicates the
line of the innermost frame where the debugged program has stopped. A
hollow arrow indicates the current execution line of a higher-level
frame.  If you drag the arrow in the fringe with <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>, that
causes execution to advance to the line where you release the button. 
Alternatively, you can click <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> in the fringe to advance to
that line.  You can click <kbd>C-Mouse-3</kbd> in the fringe to jump to
that line without executing the intermediate lines.  This command
allows you to go backwards, which can be useful for running through
code that has already executed, in order to examine its execution in
more detail.
