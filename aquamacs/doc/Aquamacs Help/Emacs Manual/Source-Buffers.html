<!-- @findex gdb-mouse-set-clear-breakpoint -->
<!-- @findex gdb-mouse-toggle-breakpoint -->
Many GDB commands can be entered using key bindings or the tool bar but
sometimes it is quicker to use the fringe.  These commands either
manipulate breakpoints or control program execution.  When there is no
fringe, you can use the margin but this is only present when the
source file already has a breakpoint.

   <p>You can click <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> in the fringe or display margin of a
source buffer to set a breakpoint there and, on a graphical display, a
red bullet will appear on that line.  If a breakpoint already exists
on that line, the same click will remove it.  You can also enable or
disable a breakpoint by clicking <kbd>C-Mouse-1</kbd> on the bullet.

   <p>A solid arrow in the left fringe of a source buffer indicates the line
of the innermost frame where the debugged program has stopped. A
hollow arrow indicates the current execution line of higher level
frames.

   <p>If you drag the arrow in the fringe with <kbd>Mouse-1</kbd>
(<code>gdb-mouse-until</code>), execution will continue to the line where
you release the button, provided it is still in the same frame. 
Alternatively, you can click <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd> at some point in the fringe
of this buffer and execution will advance to there.  A similar command
(<code>gdb-mouse-jump</code>) allows you to jump to a source line without
executing the intermediate lines by clicking <kbd>C-Mouse-3</kbd>.  This
command allows you to go backwards which can be useful for running
through code that has already executed, in order to examine its
execution in more detail.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Set or clear a breakpoint.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-Mouse-1</kbd><dd>Enable or disable a breakpoint.

     <br><dt><kbd>Mouse-3</kbd><dd>Continue execution to here.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-Mouse-3</kbd><dd>Jump to here. 
</dl>

   <p>If the variable <code>gdb-find-source-frame</code> is non-<code>nil</code> and
execution stops in a frame for which there is no source code e.g after
an interrupt, then Emacs finds and displays the first frame further up
stack for which there is source.  If it is <code>nil</code> then the source
buffer continues to display the last frame which maybe more useful,
for example, when re-setting a breakpoint.
