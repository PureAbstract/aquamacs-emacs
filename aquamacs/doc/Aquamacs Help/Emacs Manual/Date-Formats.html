<h4 class="subsection">31.10.3 Date Formats</h4>

<p>Here are some sample diary entries, illustrating different ways of
formatting a date.  The examples all show dates in American order
(month, day, year), but Calendar mode supports European order (day,
month, year) and ISO order (year, month, day) as options.

<pre class="example">     4/20/12  Switch-over to new tabulation system
     apr. 25  Start tabulating annual results
     4/30  Results for April are due
     */25  Monthly cycle finishes
     Friday  Don't leave without backing up files
</pre>
   <p>The first entry appears only once, on April 20, 2012.  The second and
third appear every year on the specified dates, and the fourth uses a
wildcard (asterisk) for the month, so it appears on the 25th of every
month.  The final entry appears every week on Friday.

   <p>You can use just numbers to express a date, as in
&lsquo;<samp><var>month</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>day</var></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><var>month</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>day</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>year</var></samp>&rsquo;. 
This must be followed by a nondigit.  In the date itself, <var>month</var>
and <var>day</var> are numbers of one or two digits.  The optional <var>year</var>
is also a number, and may be abbreviated to the last two digits; that
is, you can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">11/12/2012</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">11/12/12</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Dates can also have the form &lsquo;<samp><var>monthname</var> <var>day</var></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><var>monthname</var> <var>day</var><span class="samp">, </span><var>year</var></samp>&rsquo;, where the month's name can
be spelled in full or abbreviated (with or without a period).  The
preferred abbreviations for month and day names can be set using
the variables <code>calendar-abbrev-length</code>,
<code>calendar-month-abbrev-array</code>, and
<code>calendar-day-abbrev-array</code>.  The default is to use the first three
letters of a name as its abbreviation.  Case is not significant.

   <p>A date may be <dfn>generic</dfn>; that is, partially unspecified.  Then the
entry applies to all dates that match the specification.  If the date
does not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any year. 
Alternatively, <var>month</var>, <var>day</var>, or <var>year</var> can be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;;
this matches any month, day, or year, respectively.  Thus, a diary entry
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3/*/*</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any day in March of any year; so does &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">march
*</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-calendar_002ddate_002dstyle-3392"></a><a name="index-calendar_002dset_002ddate_002dstyle-3393"></a>  If you prefer the European style of writing dates (in which the day
comes before the month), or the ISO style (in which the order is year,
month, day), type <kbd>M-x calendar-set-date-style</kbd> while in the
calendar, or customize the variable <code>calendar-date-style</code>.  This
affects how diary dates are interpreted, date display, and the order in
which some commands expect their arguments to be given.

   <p>You can use the name of a day of the week as a generic date which
applies to any date falling on that day of the week.  You can abbreviate
the day of the week as described above, or spell it in full; case is not
significant.
