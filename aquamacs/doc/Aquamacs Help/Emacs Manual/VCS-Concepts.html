<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.3 Concepts of Version Control</h5>

<p><a name="index-repository-2750"></a><a name="index-registered-file-2751"></a>   When a file is under version control, we say that it is
<dfn>registered</dfn> in the version control system.  The system has a
<dfn>repository</dfn> which stores both the file's present state and its
change history&mdash;enough to reconstruct the current version or any
earlier version.  The repository also contains other information, such
as <dfn>log entries</dfn> that describe the changes made to each file.

   <p><a name="index-work-file-2752"></a><a name="index-checking-out-files-2753"></a>  The copy of a version-controlled file that you actually edit is
called the <dfn>work file</dfn>.  You can change each work file as you
would an ordinary file.  After you are done with a set of changes, you
may <dfn>commit</dfn> (or <dfn>check in</dfn>) the changes; this records the
changes in the repository, along with a descriptive log entry.

   <p><a name="index-working-tree-2754"></a>  A directory tree of work files is called a <dfn>working tree</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-revision-2755"></a><a name="index-revision-ID-2756"></a>  Each commit creates a new <dfn>revision</dfn> in the repository.  The
version control system keeps track of all past revisions and the
changes that were made in each revision.  Each revision is named by a
<dfn>revision ID</dfn>, whose format depends on the version control system;
in the simplest case, it is just an integer.

   <p>To go beyond these basic concepts, you will need to understand three
aspects in which version control systems differ.  As explained in the
next three sections, they can be lock-based or merge-based; file-based
or changeset-based; and centralized or decentralized.  VC handles all
these modes of operation, but it cannot hide the differences.
