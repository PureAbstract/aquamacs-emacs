<h5 class="subsubsection">32.1.1.3 Concepts of Version Control</h5>

<p><a name="index-repository-2430"></a><a name="index-registered-file-2431"></a>   When a file is under version control, we say that it is
<dfn>registered</dfn> in the version control system.  The system has a
<dfn>repository</dfn> which stores both the file's present state and its
change history&mdash;enough to reconstruct the current version or any
earlier version.  The repository also contains other information, such
as <dfn>log entries</dfn> that describe the changes made to each file.

   <p><a name="index-work-file-2432"></a><a name="index-checking-out-files-2433"></a>  A file <dfn>checked out</dfn> of a repository is called the <dfn>work
file</dfn>.  You edit the work file and make changes in it, as you would
with an ordinary file.  After you are done with a set of changes, you
<dfn>check in</dfn> or <dfn>commit</dfn> the file; this records the changes in
the repository, along with a log entry for those changes.

   <p><a name="index-revision-2434"></a><a name="index-revision-ID-2435"></a>  A copy of a file stored in a repository is called a <dfn>revision</dfn>. 
The history of a file is a sequence of revisions.  Each revision is
named by a <dfn>revision ID</dfn>.  The format of the revision ID depends
on the version control system; in the simplest case, it is just an
integer.

   <p>To go beyond these basic concepts, you will need to understand three
aspects in which version control systems differ. 
They can be locking-based or merging-based; they can be file-based or
changeset-based; and they can be centralized or decentralized.  VC
handles all these modes of operation, but it cannot hide the differences.

   <p><a name="index-locking-versus-merging-2436"></a>  A version control system typically has some mechanism to coordinate
between users who want to change the same file.  There are two ways to
do this: merging and locking.

   <p>In a version control system that uses merging, each user may check
out and modify a work file at any time.  The system lets you
<dfn>merge</dfn> your work file, which may contain changes that have not
been checked in, with the latest changes that others have checked into
the repository.

   <p>Older version control systems use a <dfn>locking</dfn> scheme instead. 
Here, work files are normally read-only.  To edit a file, you ask the
version control system to make it writable for you by <dfn>locking</dfn>
it; only one user can lock a given file at any given time.  This
procedure is analogous to, but different from, the locking that Emacs
uses to detect simultaneous editing of ordinary files
(see <a href="Interlocking.html#Interlocking">Interlocking</a>).  When you check in your changes, that unlocks
the file, and the work file becomes read-only again.  Other users may
then lock the file to make their own changes.

   <p>Both locking and merging systems can have problems when multiple
users try to modify the same file at the same time.  Locking systems
have <dfn>lock conflicts</dfn>; a user may try to check a file out and be
unable to because it is locked.  In merging systems, <dfn>merge
conflicts</dfn> happen when you check in a change to a file that conflicts
with a change checked in by someone else after your checkout.  Both
kinds of conflict have to be resolved by human judgment and
communication.  Experience has shown that merging is superior to
locking, both in convenience to developers and in minimizing the
number and severity of conflicts that actually occur.

   <p>SCCS always uses locking.  RCS is lock-based by default but can be
told to operate in a merging style.  CVS and Subversion are
merge-based by default but can be told to operate in a locking mode. 
Distributed version control systems, such as GNU Arch, git, and
Mercurial, are exclusively merging-based.

   <p>VC mode supports both locking and merging version control.  The
terms &ldquo;checkin&rdquo; and &ldquo;checkout&rdquo; come from locking-based version
control systems; newer version control systems have slightly different
operations usually called &ldquo;commit&rdquo; and &ldquo;update&rdquo;, but VC hides the
differences between them as much as possible.

   <p><a name="index-files-versus-changesets_002e-2437"></a>  On SCCS, RCS, CVS, and other early version control systems, version
control operations are <dfn>file-based</dfn>: each file has its own comment
and revision history separate from that of all other files in the
system.  Later systems, beginning with Subversion, are
<dfn>changeset-based</dfn>: a checkin may include changes to several files,
and the entire set of changes is treated as a unit by the system.  Any
comment associated with the change does not belong to a single file,
but to the changeset itself.

   <p>Changeset-based version control is more flexible and powerful than
file-based version control; usually, when a change to multiple files
has to be reversed, it's good to be able to easily identify and remove
all of it.

   <p><a name="index-centralized-vs_002e-decentralized-version-control-2438"></a>  Early version control systems were designed around a
<dfn>centralized</dfn> model in which each project has only one repository
used by all developers.  SCCS, RCS, CVS, and Subversion share this
kind of model.  One of its drawbacks is that the repository is a choke
point for reliability and efficiency.

   <p>GNU Arch pioneered the concept of <dfn>decentralized</dfn> version
control, later implemented in git, Mercurial, and Bazaar.  A project
may have several different repositories, and these systems support a
sort of super-merge between repositories that tries to reconcile their
change histories.  At the limit, each developer has his/her own
repository, and repository merges replace checkin/commit operations.

   <p>VC's job is to help you manage the traffic between your personal
workfiles and a repository.  Whether that repository is a single
master or one of a network of peer repositories is not something VC
has to care about.  Thus, the difference between a centralized and a
decentralized version control system is invisible to VC mode.
