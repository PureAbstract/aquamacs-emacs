<h3 class="section">1.2 The Echo Area</h3>

<p><a name="index-echo-area-5"></a>
  The line at the very bottom of the frame is the <dfn>echo area</dfn>.  It
is used to display small amounts of text for various purposes.

   <p><dfn>Echoing</dfn> means displaying the characters that you type. 
Single-character commands, including most simple editing operations,
are not echoed.  Multi-character commands are echoed if you pause
while typing them: if you pause for more than a second in the middle
of a command, Emacs echoes all the characters of the command so far,
to prompt you for the rest of the command.  The echoed characters are
displayed in the echo area.  Once echoing has started, the rest of the
command echoes immediately as you type it.  This behavior is designed
to give confident users fast response, while giving hesitant users
maximum feedback.  See <a href="Display-Custom.html#Display-Custom">Display Custom</a>.

   <p><a name="index-error-message-in-the-echo-area-6"></a>  If a command cannot do its job, it may display an <dfn>error
message</dfn>.  Error messages are also displayed in the echo area.  They
may be accompanied by beeping or by flashing the screen.

   <p>Some commands display informative messages in the echo area.  Unlike
error messages, these messages are not announced with a beep or flash. 
Sometimes the message tells you what the command has done, when this
is not obvious from looking at the text being edited.  Other times,
the sole purpose of a command is to show you a message giving you
specific information.  For example, <kbd>C-x =</kbd> (hold down &lt;CTRL&gt;
and type <kbd>x</kbd>, then let go of &lt;CTRL&gt; and type <kbd>=</kbd>) displays
a message describing the character position of point in the text and
its current column in the window.  Commands that take a long time
often display messages ending in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">...</span></samp>&rsquo; while they are working,
and add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">done</span></samp>&rsquo; at the end when they are finished.  They may also
indicate progress with percentages.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002aMessages_002a_007d-buffer-7"></a><a name="index-saved-echo-area-messages-8"></a><a name="index-messages-saved-from-echo-area-9"></a><a name="index-message_002dlog_002dmax-10"></a>  Informative echo-area messages are saved in a special buffer named
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Messages*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (We have not explained buffers yet; see
<a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>, for more information about them.)  If you miss a
message that appeared briefly on the screen, you can switch to the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Messages*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer to see it again.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Messages*</span></samp>&rsquo;
buffer is limited to a certain number of lines, specified by the
variable <code>message-log-max</code>.  (We have not explained variables
either; see <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>, for more information about them.)  Beyond
this limit, one line is deleted from the beginning whenever a new
message line is added at the end.

   <p><a name="index-minibuffer-11"></a>  The echo area is also used to display the <dfn>minibuffer</dfn>, a
special window where you can input arguments to commands, such as the
name of a file to be edited.  When the minibuffer is in use, the text
displayed in the echo area begins with a <dfn>prompt string</dfn> (usually
ending with a colon); also, the active cursor appears within the
minibuffer, which is temporarily considered the selected window.  You
can always get out of the minibuffer by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>. 
See <a href="Minibuffer.html#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>.
