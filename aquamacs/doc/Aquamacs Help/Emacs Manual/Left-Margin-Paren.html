<h4 class="subsection">26.2.1 Left Margin Convention</h4>

<p><a name="index-open_002dparenthesis-in-leftmost-column-2242"></a><a name="index-g_t_0028-in-leftmost-column-2243"></a>  Many programming-language modes assume by default that any opening
delimiter found at the left margin is the start of a top-level
definition, or defun.  Therefore, <strong>don't put an opening
delimiter at the left margin unless it should have that significance</strong>. 
For instance, never put an open-parenthesis at the left margin in a
Lisp file unless it is the start of a top-level list.

   <p>The convention speeds up many Emacs operations, which would
otherwise have to scan back to the beginning of the buffer to analyze
the syntax of the code.

   <p>If you don't follow this convention, not only will you have trouble
when you explicitly use the commands for motion by defuns; other
features that use them will also give you trouble.  This includes the
indentation commands (see <a href="Program-Indent.html#Program-Indent">Program Indent</a>) and Font Lock mode
(see <a href="Font-Lock.html#Font-Lock">Font Lock</a>).

   <p>The most likely problem case is when you want an opening delimiter
at the start of a line inside a string.  To avoid trouble, put an
escape character (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo;, in C and Emacs Lisp, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/</span></samp>&rsquo; in some
other Lisp dialects) before the opening delimiter.  This will not
affect the contents of the string, but will prevent that opening
delimiter from starting a defun.  Here's an example:

<pre class="example">       (insert "Foo:
     \(bar)
     ")
</pre>
   <p>To help you catch violations of this convention, Font Lock mode
highlights confusing opening delimiters (those that ought to be
quoted) in bold red.

   <p><a name="index-open_002dparen_002din_002dcolumn_002d0_002dis_002ddefun_002dstart-2244"></a>  If you need to override this convention, you can do so by setting
the variable <code>open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start</code>. 
If this user option is set to <code>t</code> (the default), opening
parentheses or braces at column zero always start defuns.  When it is
<code>nil</code>, defuns are found by searching for parens or braces at the
outermost level.

   <p>Usually, you should leave this option at its default value of
<code>t</code>.  If your buffer contains parentheses or braces in column
zero which don't start defuns, and it is somehow impractical to remove
these parentheses or braces, it might be helpful to set the option to
<code>nil</code>.  Be aware that this might make scrolling and display in
large buffers quite sluggish.  Furthermore, the parentheses and braces
must be correctly matched throughout the buffer for it to work
properly.
