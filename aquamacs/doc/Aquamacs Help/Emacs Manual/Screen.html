<h2 class="chapter">1 The Organization of the Screen</h2>

<p><a name="index-screen-1"></a><a name="index-parts-of-the-screen-2"></a>
  On a text-only terminal, the Emacs display occupies the entire
terminal screen.  On a graphical display, such as on GNU/Linux using
the X Window System, Emacs creates its own windows to use.  We use the
term <dfn>frame</dfn> to mean the entire terminal screen or graphical
window used by Emacs.  Emacs uses both kinds of frames, in the same
way, to display your editing.  Emacs normally starts out with just one
frame, but you can create additional frames if you wish
(see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>).

   <p>The frame consists of several distinct regions.  At the top of the
frame is a <dfn>menu bar</dfn>, which allows you to access commands via a
series of menus.  On a graphical display, directly below the menu bar
is a <dfn>tool bar</dfn>, a row of icons that perform editing commands if
you click on them.  At the very bottom of the frame is a special
<dfn>echo area</dfn>, where short informative messages are displayed and
where you enter information when Emacs asks for it.

   <p>The main area of the frame, below the tool bar (if one exists) and
above the echo area, is called <dfn>the window</dfn>.  This is where Emacs
displays the <dfn>buffer</dfn>: the text that you are editing.  On a
graphical display, the window possesses a <dfn>scroll bar</dfn> on one
side, which you can use to display different parts of the buffer in
the window.  The last line of the window is a <dfn>mode line</dfn>.  This
displays various information about what is going on in the buffer,
such as whether there are unsaved changes, the editing modes that are
in use, the current line number, and so forth.

   <p>When you start Emacs, there is normally only one window in the
frame.  However, you can subdivide this window horizontally or
vertically to create multiple windows, each of which can independently
display a buffer (see <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>).  In this manual, the word
&ldquo;window&rdquo; refers to the initial large window if not subdivided, or
any one of the multiple windows you have subdivided it into.

   <p>At any time, one window is the <dfn>selected window</dfn>.  On graphical
displays, the selected window normally shows a more prominent cursor
(usually solid and blinking) while other windows show a weaker cursor
(such as a hollow box).  Text terminals have just one cursor, so it
always appears in the selected window.  The buffer displayed in the
selected window is called the <dfn>current buffer</dfn>, and it is where
editing happens.  Most Emacs commands implicitly apply to the current
buffer; the text displayed in unselected windows is mostly visible for
reference.  If you use multiple frames on a graphical display,
selecting a particular frame selects a window in that frame.
