<h2 class="chapter">1 The Organization of the Screen</h2>

<p><a name="index-screen-1"></a><a name="index-frame-2"></a>
  On a graphical display, such as on GNU/Linux using the X Window
System, Emacs occupies a &ldquo;graphical window&rdquo;.  On a text terminal,
Emacs occupies the entire terminal screen.  We will use the term
<dfn>frame</dfn> to mean a graphical window or terminal screen occupied by
Emacs.  Emacs behaves very similarly on both kinds of frames.  It
normally starts out with just one frame, but you can create additional
frames if you wish (see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>).

   <p>Each frame consists of several distinct regions.  At the top of the
frame is a <dfn>menu bar</dfn>, which allows you to access commands via a
series of menus.  On a graphical display, directly below the menu bar
is a <dfn>tool bar</dfn>, a row of icons that perform editing commands if
you click on them.  At the very bottom of the frame is an <dfn>echo
area</dfn>, where informative messages are displayed and where you enter
information when Emacs asks for it.

   <p>The main area of the frame, below the tool bar (if one exists) and
above the echo area, is called <dfn>the window</dfn>.  Henceforth in this
manual, we will use the word &ldquo;window&rdquo; in this sense.  Graphical
display systems commonly use the word &ldquo;window&rdquo; with a different
meaning; but, as stated above, we refer to those &ldquo;graphical windows&rdquo;
as &ldquo;frames&rdquo;.

   <p>An Emacs window is where the <dfn>buffer</dfn>&mdash;the text you are
editing&mdash;is displayed.  On a graphical display, the window possesses
a <dfn>scroll bar</dfn> on one side, which can be used to scroll through
the buffer.  The last line of the window is a <dfn>mode line</dfn>.  This
displays various information about what is going on in the buffer,
such as whether there are unsaved changes, the editing modes that are
in use, the current line number, and so forth.

   <p>When you start Emacs, there is normally only one window in the
frame.  However, you can subdivide this window horizontally or
vertically to create multiple windows, each of which can independently
display a buffer (see <a href="Windows.html#Windows">Windows</a>).

   <p>At any time, one window is the <dfn>selected window</dfn>.  On a
graphical display, the selected window shows a more prominent cursor
(usually solid and blinking); other windows show a less prominent
cursor (usually a hollow box).  On a text terminal, there is only one
cursor, which is shown in the selected window.  The buffer displayed
in the selected window is called the <dfn>current buffer</dfn>, and it is
where editing happens.  Most Emacs commands implicitly apply to the
current buffer; the text displayed in unselected windows is mostly
visible for reference.  If you use multiple frames on a graphical
display, selecting a particular frame selects a window in that frame.
