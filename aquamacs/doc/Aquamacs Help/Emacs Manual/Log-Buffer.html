<h4 class="subsection">32.1.4 Features of the Log Entry Buffer</h4>

<p>When you tell VC to commit a change, it pops up a buffer called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In this buffer, you should write a <dfn>log entry</dfn>
describing the changes you have made (see <a href="Why-Version-Control_003f.html#Why-Version-Control_003f">Why Version Control?</a>). 
After you are done, type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>; this exits the buffer and
commits the change, together with your log entry.

   <p>While in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, you can write one or more
<dfn>header lines</dfn>, specifying additional information to be supplied
to the version control system.  Each header line must occupy a single
line at the top of the buffer; the first line that is not a header
line is treated as the start of the log entry.  For example, the
following header line states that the present change was not written
by you, but by another developer:

<pre class="smallexample">     Author: J. R. Hacker &lt;jrh@example.com&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Apart from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Author</span></samp>&rsquo; header, Emacs recognizes the headers
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Date</span></samp>&rsquo; (a manually-specified commit time) and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Fixes</span></samp>&rsquo; (a
reference to a bug fixed by the change).  Not all version control
systems recognize all headers: Bazaar recognizes all three headers,
while git, Mercurial, and Monotone recognizes only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Author</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Summary</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you specify a header for a version control that
does not support it, the header is treated as part of the log entry.

   <p><a name="index-log_002dedit_002dshow_002dfiles-2488"></a><a name="index-log_002dedit_002dshow_002ddiff-2489"></a>  Type <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> (<code>log-edit-show-files</code>) to display a list of
files in the current VC fileset.  If you called <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> directly
from a work file, the fileset consists of that single file; if you
called <kbd>C-x v v</kbd> from a VC directory buffer (see <a href="VC-Directory-Mode.html#VC-Directory-Mode">VC Directory Mode</a>), the fileset may consist of multiple files.

   <p><a name="index-log_002dedit_002dinsert_002dchangelog-2490"></a>  Type <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> (<code>log-edit-show-diff</code>) to show a <dfn>diff</dfn>
of the changes you have made (i.e., the differences between the work
file and the repository revision from which you started editing). 
See <a href="Old-Revisions.html#Old-Revisions">Old Revisions</a>.

   <p>If the current VC fileset includes one or more <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp>
files (see <a href="Change-Log.html#Change-Log">Change Log</a>), type <kbd>C-c C-a</kbd>
(<code>log-edit-insert-changelog</code>) to pull the relevant entries into
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.  If the topmost item in each
<samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> was made under your user name on the current date,
this command searches that item for entries that match the file(s) to
be committed; if found, these entries are inserted. 
See <a href="Change-Logs-and-VC.html#Change-Logs-and-VC">Change Logs and VC</a>,
for the opposite way of working&mdash;generating ChangeLog entries from
the revision control log.

   <p>To abort a check-in, just <strong>don't</strong> type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> in that
buffer.  You can switch buffers and do other editing.  As long as you
don't try to commit another file, the entry you were editing remains
in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*VC-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, and you can go back to that buffer at
any time to complete the check-in.

   <p>If you change several source files for the same reason, it is often
convenient to specify the same log entry for many of the files.  (This
is the normal way to do things on a changeset-oriented system, where
comments are attached to changesets rather than the history of
individual files.)  The most convenient way to do this is to mark all
the files in VC Directory Mode and commit from there; the log buffer
will carry the fileset information with it and do a group commit when
you type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>.

   <p>You can also browse the history of previous log entries to duplicate
a checkin comment. This can be useful when you want several files to
have checkin comments that vary only slightly from each other. The
commands <kbd>M-n</kbd>, <kbd>M-p</kbd>, <kbd>M-s</kbd> and <kbd>M-r</kbd> for doing this
work just like the minibuffer history commands (except that these
versions are used outside the minibuffer).

   <p><a name="index-vc_002dlog_002dmode_002dhook-2491"></a>  Each time you commit a change, the log entry buffer is put into VC
Log Edit mode, which involves running two hooks: <code>text-mode-hook</code>
and <code>vc-log-mode-hook</code>.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.
