<h3 class="section">47.2 Package Installation</h3>

<p><a name="index-package_002dinstall-4292"></a>  Packages are most conveniently installed using the package menu
(see <a href="Package-Menu.html#Package-Menu">Package Menu</a>), but you can also use the command <kbd>M-x
package-install</kbd>.  This prompts for the name of a package with the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">available</span></samp>&rsquo; status, then downloads and installs it.

   <p><a name="index-package-requirements-4293"></a>  A package may <dfn>require</dfn> certain other packages to be installed,
because it relies on functionality provided by them.  When Emacs
installs such a package, it also automatically downloads and installs
any required package that is not already installed.  (If a required
package is somehow unavailable, Emacs signals an error and stops
installation.)  A package's requirements list is shown in its help
buffer.

   <p><a name="index-package_002darchives-4294"></a>  By default, packages are downloaded from a single package archive
maintained by the Emacs developers.  This is controlled by the
variable <code>package-archives</code>, whose value is a list of package
archives known to Emacs.  Each list element must have the form
<code>(</code><var>id</var><code> . </code><var>location</var><code>)</code>, where <var>id</var> is the name of a
package archive and <var>location</var> is the <acronym>HTTP</acronym> address or
directory name of the package archive.  You can alter this list if you
wish to use third party package archives&mdash;but do so at your own risk,
and use only third parties that you think you can trust!

   <p>Once a package is downloaded and installed, it is <dfn>loaded</dfn> into
the current Emacs session.  Loading a package is not quite the same as
loading a Lisp library (see <a href="Lisp-Libraries.html#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a>); its effect varies
from package to package.  Most packages just make some new commands
available, while others have more wide-ranging effects on the Emacs
session.  For such information, consult the package's help buffer.

   <p>By default, Emacs also automatically loads all installed packages in
subsequent Emacs sessions.  This happens at startup, after processing
the init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>).  As an exception, Emacs does not
load packages at startup if invoked with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--no-init-file</span></samp>&rsquo; options (see <a href="Initial-Options.html#Initial-Options">Initial Options</a>).

   <p><a name="index-package_002denable_002dat_002dstartup-4295"></a>  To disable automatic package loading, change the variable
<code>package-enable-at-startup</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p><a name="index-package_002dinitialize-4296"></a>  The reason automatic package loading occurs after loading the init
file is that user options only receive their customized values after
loading the init file, including user options which affect the
packaging system.  In some circumstances, you may want to load
packages explicitly in your init file (usually because some other code
in your init file depends on a package).  In that case, your init file
should call the function <code>package-initialize</code>.  It is up to you
to ensure that relevant user options, such as <code>package-load-list</code>
(see below), are set up prior to the <code>package-initialize</code> call. 
You should also set <code>package-enable-at-startup</code> to <code>nil</code>, to
avoid loading the packages again after processing the init file. 
Alternatively, you may choose to completely inhibit package loading at
startup, and invoke the command <kbd>M-x package-initialize</kbd> to load
your packages manually.

   <p><a name="index-package_002dload_002dlist-4297"></a>  For finer control over package loading, you can use the variable
<code>package-load-list</code>.  Its value should be a list.  A list element
of the form <code>(</code><var>name</var> <var>version</var><code>)</code> tells Emacs to load
version <var>version</var> of the package named <var>name</var>.  Here,
<var>version</var> should be a version string (corresponding to a specific
version of the package), or <code>t</code> (which means to load any
installed version), or <code>nil</code> (which means no version; this
&ldquo;disables&rdquo; the package, preventing it from being loaded).  A list
element can also be the symbol <code>all</code>, which means to load the
latest installed version of any package not named by the other list
elements.  The default value is just <code>'(all)</code>.

   <p>For example, if you set <code>package-load-list</code> to <code>'((muse
"3.20") all)</code>, then Emacs only loads version 3.20 of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">muse</span></samp>&rsquo;
package, plus any installed version of packages other than
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">muse</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Any other version of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">muse</span></samp>&rsquo; that happens to be
installed will be ignored.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">muse</span></samp>&rsquo; package will be listed in
the package menu with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">held</span></samp>&rsquo; status.
