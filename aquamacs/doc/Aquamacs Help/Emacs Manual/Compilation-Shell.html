<h3 class="section">27.3 Subshells for Compilation</h3>

<p>The <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> command uses a shell to run the compilation
command, but specifies the option for a noninteractive shell.  This
means, in particular, that the shell should start with no prompt.  If
you find your usual shell prompt making an unsightly appearance in the
<samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffer, it means you have made a mistake in your
shell's init file by setting the prompt unconditionally.  (This init
file may be named <samp><span class="file">.bashrc</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.profile</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.cshrc</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">.shrc</span></samp>, etc., depending on what shell you use.)  The shell init
file should set the prompt only if there already is a prompt.  Here's
how to do it in bash:

<pre class="example">     if [ "${PS1+set}" = set ]
     then PS1=...
     fi
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">And here's how to do it in csh:

<pre class="example">     if ($?prompt) set prompt = ...
</pre>
   <p>Emacs does not expect a compiler process to launch asynchronous
subprocesses; if it does, and they keep running after the main
compiler process has terminated, Emacs may kill them or their output
may not arrive in Emacs.  To avoid this problem, make the main
compilation process wait for its subprocesses to finish.  In a shell
script, you can do this using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$!</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">wait</span></samp>&rsquo;, like this:

<pre class="example">     (sleep 10; echo 2nd)&amp; pid=$!  # <span class="roman">Record pid of subprocess</span>
     echo first message
     wait $pid                     # <span class="roman">Wait for subprocess</span>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the background process does not output to the compilation buffer,
so you only need to prevent it from being killed when the main
compilation process terminates, this is sufficient:

<pre class="example">     nohup <var>command</var>; sleep 1
</pre>
   <p>On the MS-DOS &ldquo;operating system&rdquo;, asynchronous subprocesses are
not supported, so <kbd>M-x compile</kbd> runs the compilation command
synchronously (i.e., you must wait until the command finishes before
you can do anything else in Emacs).  See <a href="MS_002dDOS.html#MS_002dDOS">MS-DOS</a>.
