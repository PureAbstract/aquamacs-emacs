<p><a name="index-text-and-binary-files-on-MS_002dDOS_002fMS_002dWindows-4720"></a>
  GNU Emacs uses newline characters to separate text lines.  This is the
convention used on GNU, Unix, and other Posix-compliant systems.

   <p><a name="index-end_002dof_002dline-conversion-on-MS_002dDOS_002fMS_002dWindows-4721"></a>  By contrast, MS-DOS and MS-Windows normally use carriage-return linefeed,
a two-character sequence, to separate text lines.  (Linefeed is the same
character as newline.)  Therefore, convenient editing of typical files
with Emacs requires conversion of these end-of-line (EOL) sequences. 
And that is what Emacs normally does: it converts carriage-return
linefeed into newline when reading files, and converts newline into
carriage-return linefeed when writing files.  The same mechanism that
handles conversion of international character codes does this conversion
also (see <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>).

   <p><a name="index-cursor-location_002c-on-MS_002dDOS-4722"></a><a name="index-point-location_002c-on-MS_002dDOS-4723"></a>  One consequence of this special format-conversion of most files is
that character positions as reported by Emacs (see <a href="Position-Info.html#Position-Info">Position Info</a>) do
not agree with the file size information known to the operating system.

   <p>In addition, if Emacs recognizes from a file's contents that it uses
newline rather than carriage-return linefeed as its line separator, it
does not perform EOL conversion when reading or writing that file. 
Thus, you can read and edit files from GNU and Unix systems on MS-DOS
with no special effort, and they will retain their Unix-style
end-of-line convention after you edit them.

   <p>The mode line indicates whether end-of-line translation was used for
the current buffer.  If MS-DOS end-of-line translation is in use for the
buffer, the MS-Windows build of Emacs displays a backslash &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; after
the coding system mnemonic near the beginning of the mode line
(see <a href="Mode-Line.html#Mode-Line">Mode Line</a>).  If no EOL translation was performed, the string
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(Unix)</span></samp>&rsquo; is displayed instead of the backslash, to alert you that the
file's EOL format is not the usual carriage-return linefeed.

   <p><a name="index-DOS_002dto_002dUnix-conversion-of-files-4724"></a>  To visit a file and specify whether it uses DOS-style or Unix-style
end-of-line, specify a coding system (see <a href="Text-Coding.html#Text-Coding">Text Coding</a>).  For
example, <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; c unix &lt;RET&gt; C-x C-f foobar.txt</kbd>
visits the file <samp><span class="file">foobar.txt</span></samp> without converting the EOLs; if some
line ends with a carriage-return linefeed pair, Emacs will display
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^M</span></samp>&rsquo; at the end of that line.  Similarly, you can direct Emacs to
save a buffer in a specified EOL format with the <kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; f</kbd>
command.  For example, to save a buffer with Unix EOL format, type
<kbd>C-x &lt;RET&gt; f unix &lt;RET&gt; C-x C-s</kbd>.  If you visit a file
with DOS EOL conversion, then save it with Unix EOL format, that
effectively converts the file to Unix EOL style, like the
<code>dos2unix</code> program.

   <p><a name="index-untranslated-file-system-4725"></a><a name="index-add_002duntranslated_002dfilesystem-4726"></a>  When you use NFS, Samba, or some other similar method to access file
systems that reside on computers using GNU or Unix systems, Emacs
should not perform end-of-line translation on any files in these file
systems&mdash;not even when you create a new file.  To request this,
designate these file systems as <dfn>untranslated</dfn> file systems by
calling the function <code>add-untranslated-filesystem</code>.  It takes one
argument: the file system name, including a drive letter and
optionally a directory.  For example,

<pre class="example">     (add-untranslated-filesystem "Z:")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">designates drive Z as an untranslated file system, and

<pre class="example">     (add-untranslated-filesystem "Z:\\foo")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">designates directory <samp><span class="file">\foo</span></samp> on drive Z as an untranslated file
system.

   <p>Most often you would use <code>add-untranslated-filesystem</code> in your
<samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file, or in <samp><span class="file">site-start.el</span></samp> so that all the users at
your site get the benefit of it.

   <p><a name="index-remove_002duntranslated_002dfilesystem-4727"></a>  To countermand the effect of <code>add-untranslated-filesystem</code>, use
the function <code>remove-untranslated-filesystem</code>.  This function takes
one argument, which should be a string just like the one that was used
previously with <code>add-untranslated-filesystem</code>.

   <p>Designating a file system as untranslated does not affect character
set conversion, only end-of-line conversion.  Essentially, it directs
Emacs to create new files with the Unix-style convention of using
newline at the end of a line.  See <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.
