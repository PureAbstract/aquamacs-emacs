<h5 class="subsubsection">28.1.1.5 Changeset-based vs File-based Version Control</h5>

<p><a name="index-file_002dbased-version-control-2759"></a>  On SCCS, RCS, CVS, and other early version control systems, version
control operations are <dfn>file-based</dfn>: each file has its own comment
and revision history separate from that of all other files.  Newer
systems, beginning with Subversion, are <dfn>changeset-based</dfn>: a
commit may include changes to several files, and the entire set of
changes is handled as a unit.  Any comment associated with the change
does not belong to a single file, but to the changeset itself.

   <p><a name="index-changeset_002dbased-version-control-2760"></a>  Changeset-based version control is more flexible and powerful than
file-based version control; usually, when a change to multiple files
has to be reversed, it's good to be able to easily identify and remove
all of it.
