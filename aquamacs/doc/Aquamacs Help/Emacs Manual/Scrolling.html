<h3 class="section">14.1 Scrolling</h3>

<p><a name="index-scrolling-549"></a>
  If a window is too small to display all the text in its buffer, it
displays only a portion of it.  <dfn>Scrolling</dfn> commands change which
portion of the buffer is displayed.

   <p>Scrolling &ldquo;forward&rdquo; or &ldquo;up&rdquo; advances the portion of the buffer
displayed in the window; equivalently, it moves the buffer text
upwards relative to the window.  Scrolling &ldquo;backward&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo;
displays an earlier portion of the buffer, and moves the text
downwards relative to the window.

   <p>In Emacs, scrolling &ldquo;up&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo; refers to the direction that
the text moves in the window, <em>not</em> the direction that the window
moves relative to the text.  This terminology was adopted by Emacs
before the modern meaning of &ldquo;scrolling up&rdquo; and &ldquo;scrolling down&rdquo;
became widespread.  Hence, the strange result that &lt;PageDown&gt;
scrolls &ldquo;up&rdquo; in the Emacs sense.

   <p>The portion of a buffer displayed in a window always contains point. 
If you move point past the bottom or top of the window, scrolling
occurs automatically to bring it back onscreen (see <a href="Auto-Scrolling.html#Auto-Scrolling">Auto Scrolling</a>).  You can also scroll explicitly with these commands:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-v</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;next&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;PageDown&gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll forward by nearly a full window (<code>scroll-up-command</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-v</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;prior&gt;</kbd><dt><kbd>&lt;PageUp&gt;</kbd><dd>Scroll backward (<code>scroll-down-command</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-C_002dv-550"></a><a name="index-M_002dv-551"></a><a name="index-next-552"></a><a name="index-prior-553"></a><a name="index-PageDown-554"></a><a name="index-PageUp-555"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dup_002dcommand-556"></a><a name="index-scroll_002ddown_002dcommand-557"></a>  <kbd>C-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-up-command</code>) scrolls forward by nearly the
whole window height.  The effect is to take the two lines at the
bottom of the window and put them at the top, followed by lines that
were not previously visible.  If point was in the text that scrolled
off the top, it ends up on the window's new topmost line.  The
&lt;next&gt; (or &lt;PageDown&gt;) key is equivalent to <kbd>C-v</kbd>.

   <p><kbd>M-v</kbd> (<code>scroll-down-command</code>) scrolls backward in a similar
way.  The &lt;prior&gt; (or &lt;PageUp&gt;) key is equivalent to
<kbd>M-v</kbd>.

   <p><a name="index-next_002dscreen_002dcontext_002dlines-558"></a>  The number of lines of overlap left by these scroll commands is
controlled by the variable <code>next-screen-context-lines</code>, whose
default value is 2.  You can supply the commands with a numeric prefix
argument, <var>n</var>, to scroll by <var>n</var> lines; Emacs attempts to leave
point unchanged, so that the text and point move up or down together. 
<kbd>C-v</kbd> with a negative argument is like <kbd>M-v</kbd> and vice versa.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002derror_002dtop_002dbottom-559"></a>  By default, these commands signal an error (by beeping or flashing
the screen) if no more scrolling is possible, because the window has
reached the beginning or end of the buffer.  If you change the
variable <code>scroll-error-top-bottom</code> to <code>t</code>, the command moves
point to the farthest possible position.  If point is already there,
the command signals an error.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dpreserve_002dscreen_002dposition-560"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bscroll_002dcommand_007d-property-561"></a>  Some users like scroll commands to keep point at the same screen
position, so that scrolling back to the same screen conveniently
returns point to its original position.  You can enable this behavior
via the variable <code>scroll-preserve-screen-position</code>.  If the value
is <code>t</code>, Emacs adjusts point to keep the cursor at the same screen
position whenever a scroll command moves it off-window, rather than
moving it to the topmost or bottommost line.  With any other
non-<code>nil</code> value, Emacs adjusts point this way even if the scroll
command leaves point in the window.  This variable affects all the
scroll commands documented in this section, as well as scrolling with
the mouse wheel (see <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse-Commands">Mouse Commands</a>); in general, it affects any
command that has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>scroll-command</code> property. 
See <a href="../elisp/Property-Lists.html#Property-Lists">Property Lists</a>.

   <p><a name="index-scroll_002dup-562"></a><a name="index-scroll_002ddown-563"></a><a name="index-scroll_002dup_002dline-564"></a><a name="index-scroll_002ddown_002dline-565"></a>  The commands <kbd>M-x scroll-up</kbd> and <kbd>M-x scroll-down</kbd> behave
similarly to <code>scroll-up-command</code> and <code>scroll-down-command</code>,
except they do not obey <code>scroll-error-top-bottom</code>.  Prior to
Emacs 24, these were the default commands for scrolling up and down. 
The commands <kbd>M-x scroll-up-line</kbd> and <kbd>M-x scroll-down-line</kbd>
scroll the current window by one line at a time.  If you intend to use
any of these commands, you might want to give them key bindings
(see <a href="Init-Rebinding.html#Init-Rebinding">Init Rebinding</a>).
