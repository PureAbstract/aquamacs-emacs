<h3 class="section">7.5 Files</h3>

<p>Text that you insert in an Emacs buffer lasts only as long as the
Emacs session.  To keep any text permanently, you must put it in a
<dfn>file</dfn>.

   <p>Suppose there is a file named <samp><span class="file">test.emacs</span></samp> in your home
directory.  To begin editing this file in Emacs, type

<pre class="example">     C-x C-f test.emacs &lt;RET&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here the file name is given as an <dfn>argument</dfn> to the command <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd> (<code>find-file</code>).  That command uses the <dfn>minibuffer</dfn> to
read the argument, and you type &lt;RET&gt; to terminate the argument
(see <a href="Minibuffer.html#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>).

   <p>Emacs obeys this command by <dfn>visiting</dfn> the file: it creates a
buffer, copies the contents of the file into the buffer, and then
displays the buffer for editing.  If you alter the text, you can
<dfn>save</dfn> the new text in the file by typing <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>
(<code>save-buffer</code>).  This copies the altered buffer contents back
into the file <samp><span class="file">test.emacs</span></samp>, making them permanent.  Until you
save, the changed text exists only inside Emacs, and the file
<samp><span class="file">test.emacs</span></samp> is unaltered.

   <p>To create a file, just visit it with <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> as if it already
existed.  This creates an empty buffer, in which you can insert the
text you want to put in the file.  Emacs actually creates the file the
first time you save this buffer with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>.
