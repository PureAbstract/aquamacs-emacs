<h3 class="section">30.3 Deleting Files with Dired</h3>

<p><a name="index-flagging-files-_0028in-Dired_0029-2996"></a><a name="index-deleting-files-_0028in-Dired_0029-2997"></a>
  One of the most frequent uses of Dired is to first <dfn>flag</dfn> files for
deletion, then delete the files that were flagged.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>d</kbd><dd>Flag this file for deletion (<code>dired-flag-file-deletion</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>u</kbd><dd>Remove the deletion flag (<code>dired-unmark</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>&lt;DEL&gt;</kbd><dd>Move point to previous line and remove the deletion flag on that line
(<code>dired-unmark-backward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>x</kbd><dd>Delete files flagged for deletion (<code>dired-do-flagged-delete</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-d-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-2998"></a><a name="index-dired_002dflag_002dfile_002ddeletion-2999"></a>  You can flag a file for deletion by moving to the line describing
the file and typing <kbd>d</kbd> (<code>dired-flag-file-deletion</code>).  The
deletion flag is visible as a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>&rsquo; at the beginning of the line. 
This command moves point to the next line, so that repeated <kbd>d</kbd>
commands flag successive files.  A numeric prefix argument serves as a
repeat count; a negative count means to flag preceding files.

   <p>If the region is active, the <kbd>d</kbd> command flags all files in the
region for deletion; in this case, the command does not move point,
and ignores any prefix argument.

   <p><a name="index-u-_0040r_007b_0028Dired-deletion_0029_007d-3000"></a><a name="index-DEL-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3001"></a>  The reason for flagging files for deletion, rather than deleting
files immediately, is to reduce the danger of deleting a file
accidentally.  Until you direct Dired to delete the flagged files, you
can remove deletion flags using the commands <kbd>u</kbd> and &lt;DEL&gt;. 
<kbd>u</kbd> (<code>dired-unmark</code>) works just like <kbd>d</kbd>, but removes
flags rather than making flags.  &lt;DEL&gt;
(<code>dired-unmark-backward</code>) moves upward, removing flags; it is
like <kbd>u</kbd> with argument &minus;1.  A numeric prefix argument to
either command serves as a repeat count, with a negative count meaning
to unflag in the opposite direction.  If the region is active, these
commands instead unflag all files in the region, without moving point.

   <p><a name="index-x-_0040r_007b_0028Dired_0029_007d-3002"></a><a name="index-dired_002ddo_002dflagged_002ddelete-3003"></a>  To delete flagged files, type <kbd>x</kbd>
(<code>dired-do-flagged-delete</code>).  This command displays a list of all
the file names flagged for deletion, and requests confirmation with
<kbd>yes</kbd>.  If you confirm, Dired deletes the flagged files, then
deletes their lines from the text of the Dired buffer.  The Dired
buffer, with somewhat fewer lines, remains selected.

   <p>If you answer <kbd>no</kbd> or quit with <kbd>C-g</kbd> when asked to confirm, you
return immediately to Dired, with the deletion flags still present in
the buffer, and no files actually deleted.

   <p><a name="index-recursive-deletion-3004"></a><a name="index-dired_002drecursive_002ddeletes-3005"></a>  You can delete empty directories just like other files, but normally
Dired cannot delete directories that are nonempty.  If the variable
<code>dired-recursive-deletes</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, then Dired can
delete nonempty directories including all their contents.  That can
be somewhat risky.

   <p><a name="index-delete_002dby_002dmoving_002dto_002dtrash-3006"></a>  If you change the variable <code>delete-by-moving-to-trash</code> to
<code>t</code>, the above deletion commands will move the affected files or
directories into the operating system's Trash, instead of deleting
them outright.  See <a href="Misc-File-Ops.html#Misc-File-Ops">Misc File Ops</a>.
