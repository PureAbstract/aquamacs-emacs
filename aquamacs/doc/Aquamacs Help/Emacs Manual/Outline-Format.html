<h4 class="subsection">25.8.1 Format of Outlines</h4>

<p><a name="index-heading-lines-_0028Outline-mode_0029-1891"></a><a name="index-body-lines-_0028Outline-mode_0029-1892"></a>  Outline mode assumes that the lines in the buffer are of two types:
<dfn>heading lines</dfn> and <dfn>body lines</dfn>.  A heading line represents a
topic in the outline.  Heading lines start with one or more asterisk
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;) characters; the number of asterisks determines the depth of
the heading in the outline structure.  Thus, a heading line with one
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; is a major topic; all the heading lines with two &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;s
between it and the next one-&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; heading are its subtopics; and so
on.  Any line that is not a heading line is a body line.  Body lines
belong with the preceding heading line.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     * Food
     This is the body,
     which says something about the topic of food.
     
     ** Delicious Food
     This is the body of the second-level header.
     
     ** Distasteful Food
     This could have
     a body too, with
     several lines.
     
     *** Dormitory Food
     
     * Shelter
     Another first-level topic with its header line.
</pre>
   <p>A heading line together with all following body lines is called
collectively an <dfn>entry</dfn>.  A heading line together with all following
deeper heading lines and their body lines is called a <dfn>subtree</dfn>.

   <p><a name="index-outline_002dregexp-1893"></a>  You can customize the criterion for distinguishing heading lines by
setting the variable <code>outline-regexp</code>.  (The recommended ways to
do this are in a major mode function or with a file local variable.) 
Any line whose beginning has a match for this regexp is considered a
heading line.  Matches that start within a line (not at the left
margin) do not count.

   <p>The length of the matching text determines the level of the heading;
longer matches make a more deeply nested level.  Thus, for example, if
a text formatter has commands &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@chapter</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@section</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@subsection</span></samp>&rsquo; to divide the document into chapters and sections,
you could make those lines count as heading lines by setting
<code>outline-regexp</code> to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"@chap\\|@\\(sub\\)*section"</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Note
the trick: the two words &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">chapter</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">section</span></samp>&rsquo; are equally
long, but by defining the regexp to match only &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">chap</span></samp>&rsquo; we ensure
that the length of the text matched on a chapter heading is shorter,
so that Outline mode will know that sections are contained in
chapters.  This works as long as no other command starts with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@chap</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-outline_002dlevel-1894"></a>  You can explicitly specify a rule for calculating the level of a
heading line by setting the variable <code>outline-level</code>.  The value
of <code>outline-level</code> should be a function that takes no arguments
and returns the level of the current heading.  The recommended ways to
set this variable are in a major mode command or with a file local
variable.
