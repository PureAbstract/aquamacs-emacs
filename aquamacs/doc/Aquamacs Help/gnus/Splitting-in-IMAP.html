<h4 class="subsection">6.5.1 Splitting in IMAP</h4>

<p><a name="index-splitting-imap-mail-2357"></a>
Splitting is something Gnus users have loved and used for years, and now
the rest of the world is catching up.  Yeah, dream on, not many
<acronym>IMAP</acronym> servers have server side splitting and those that have
splitting seem to use some non-standard protocol.  This means that
<acronym>IMAP</acronym> support for Gnus has to do its own splitting.

   <p>And it does.

   <p>(Incidentally, people seem to have been dreaming on, and Sieve has
gaining a market share and is supported by several IMAP servers. 
Fortunately, Gnus support it too, See <a href="Sieve-Commands.html#Sieve-Commands">Sieve Commands</a>.)

   <p>Here are the variables of interest:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nnimap-split-crosspost</code><dd><a name="index-splitting_002c-crosspost-2358"></a><a name="index-crosspost-2359"></a><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002dcrosspost-2360"></a>
If non-<code>nil</code>, do crossposting if several split methods match the
mail.  If <code>nil</code>, the first match in <code>nnimap-split-rule</code>
found will be used.

     <p>Nnmail equivalent: <code>nnmail-crosspost</code>.

     <br><dt><code>nnimap-split-inbox</code><dd><a name="index-splitting_002c-inbox-2361"></a><a name="index-inbox-2362"></a><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002dinbox-2363"></a>
A string or a list of strings that gives the name(s) of <acronym>IMAP</acronym>
mailboxes to split from.  Defaults to <code>nil</code>, which means that
splitting is disabled!

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq nnimap-split-inbox
                '("INBOX" ("~/friend/Mail" . "lists/*") "lists.imap"))
</pre>
     <p>No nnmail equivalent.

     <br><dt><code>nnimap-split-rule</code><dd><a name="index-splitting_002c-rules-2364"></a><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002drule-2365"></a>
New mail found in <code>nnimap-split-inbox</code> will be split according to
this variable.

     <p>This variable contains a list of lists, where the first element in the
sublist gives the name of the <acronym>IMAP</acronym> mailbox to move articles
matching the regexp in the second element in the sublist.  Got that? 
Neither did I, we need examples.

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq nnimap-split-rule
                '(("INBOX.nnimap"
                   "^Sender: owner-nnimap@vic20.globalcom.se")
                  ("INBOX.junk"    "^Subject:.*MAKE MONEY")
                  ("INBOX.private" "")))
</pre>
     <p>This will put all articles from the nnimap mailing list into mailbox
INBOX.nnimap, all articles containing MAKE MONEY in the Subject: line
into INBOX.junk and everything else in INBOX.private.

     <p>The first string may contain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\\1</span></samp>&rsquo; forms, like the ones used by
replace-match to insert sub-expressions from the matched text.  For
instance:

     <pre class="lisp">          ("INBOX.lists.\\1"     "^Sender: owner-\\([a-z-]+\\)@")
</pre>
     <p>The first element can also be the symbol <code>junk</code> to indicate that
matching messages should simply be deleted.  Use with care.

     <p>The second element can also be a function.  In that case, it will be
called with the first element of the rule as the argument, in a buffer
containing the headers of the article.  It should return a
non-<code>nil</code> value if it thinks that the mail belongs in that group.

     <p>Nnmail users might recollect that the last regexp had to be empty to
match all articles (like in the example above).  This is not required in
nnimap.  Articles not matching any of the regexps will not be moved out
of your inbox.  (This might affect performance if you keep lots of
unread articles in your inbox, since the splitting code would go over
them every time you fetch new mail.)

     <p>These rules are processed from the beginning of the alist toward the
end.  The first rule to make a match will &ldquo;win&rdquo;, unless you have
crossposting enabled.  In that case, all matching rules will &ldquo;win&rdquo;.

     <p>This variable can also have a function as its value, the function will
be called with the headers narrowed and should return a group where it
thinks the article should be split to.  See <code>nnimap-split-fancy</code>.

     <p>The splitting code tries to create mailboxes if it needs to.

     <p>To allow for different split rules on different virtual servers, and
even different split rules in different inboxes on the same server,
the syntax of this variable have been extended along the lines of:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq nnimap-split-rule
                '(("my1server"    (".*" (("ding"    "ding@gnus.org")
                                         ("junk"    "From:.*Simon"))))
                  ("my2server"    ("INBOX" nnimap-split-fancy))
                  ("my[34]server" (".*" (("private" "To:.*Simon")
                                         ("junk"    my-junk-func))))))
</pre>
     <p>The virtual server name is in fact a regexp, so that the same rules
may apply to several servers.  In the example, the servers
<code>my3server</code> and <code>my4server</code> both use the same rules. 
Similarly, the inbox string is also a regexp.  The actual splitting
rules are as before, either a function, or a list with group/regexp or
group/function elements.

     <p>Nnmail equivalent: <code>nnmail-split-methods</code>.

     <br><dt><code>nnimap-split-predicate</code><dd><a name="index-splitting-2366"></a><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002dpredicate-2367"></a>
Mail matching this predicate in <code>nnimap-split-inbox</code> will be
split, it is a string and the default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">UNSEEN UNDELETED</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>This might be useful if you use another <acronym>IMAP</acronym> client to read mail in
your inbox but would like Gnus to split all articles in the inbox
regardless of readedness.  Then you might change this to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">UNDELETED</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>nnimap-split-fancy</code><dd><a name="index-splitting_002c-fancy-2368"></a><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002dfancy-2369"></a><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002dfancy-2370"></a>
It's possible to set <code>nnimap-split-rule</code> to
<code>nnmail-split-fancy</code> if you want to use fancy
splitting.  See <a href="Fancy-Mail-Splitting.html#Fancy-Mail-Splitting">Fancy Mail Splitting</a>.

     <p>However, to be able to have different fancy split rules for nnmail and
nnimap back ends you can set <code>nnimap-split-rule</code> to
<code>nnimap-split-fancy</code> and define the nnimap specific fancy split
rule in <code>nnimap-split-fancy</code>.

     <p>Example:

     <pre class="lisp">          (setq nnimap-split-rule 'nnimap-split-fancy
                nnimap-split-fancy ...)
</pre>
     <p>Nnmail equivalent: <code>nnmail-split-fancy</code>.

     <br><dt><code>nnimap-split-download-body</code><dd><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002ddownload_002dbody-2371"></a><a name="index-nnimap_002dsplit_002ddownload_002dbody-2372"></a>
Set to non-<code>nil</code> to download entire articles during splitting. 
This is generally not required, and will slow things down
considerably.  You may need it if you want to use an advanced
splitting function that analyzes the body to split the article.
