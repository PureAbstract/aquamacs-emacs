<h4 class="subsection">6.7.2 Kibozed Groups</h4>

<p><a name="index-nnkiboze-2451"></a><a name="index-kibozing-2452"></a>
<dfn>Kibozing</dfn> is defined by the <acronym>OED</acronym> as &ldquo;grepping through
(parts of) the news feed&rdquo;.  <code>nnkiboze</code> is a back end that will
do this for you.  Oh joy!  Now you can grind any <acronym>NNTP</acronym> server
down to a halt with useless requests!  Oh happiness!

   <p><a name="index-G-k-_0028Group_0029-2453"></a>To create a kibozed group, use the <kbd>G k</kbd> command in the group
buffer.

   <p>The address field of the <code>nnkiboze</code> method is, as with
<code>nnvirtual</code>, a regexp to match groups to be &ldquo;included&rdquo; in the
<code>nnkiboze</code> group.  That's where most similarities between
<code>nnkiboze</code> and <code>nnvirtual</code> end.

   <p>In addition to this regexp detailing component groups, an
<code>nnkiboze</code> group must have a score file to say what articles are
to be included in the group (see <a href="Scoring.html#Scoring">Scoring</a>).

   <p><a name="index-M_002dx-nnkiboze_002dgenerate_002dgroups-2454"></a><a name="index-nnkiboze_002dgenerate_002dgroups-2455"></a>You must run <kbd>M-x nnkiboze-generate-groups</kbd> after creating the
<code>nnkiboze</code> groups you want to have.  This command will take time. 
Lots of time.  Oodles and oodles of time.  Gnus has to fetch the
headers from all the articles in all the component groups and run them
through the scoring process to determine if there are any articles in
the groups that are to be part of the <code>nnkiboze</code> groups.

   <p>Please limit the number of component groups by using restrictive
regexps.  Otherwise your sysadmin may become annoyed with you, and the
<acronym>NNTP</acronym> site may throw you off and never let you back in again. 
Stranger things have happened.

   <p><code>nnkiboze</code> component groups do not have to be alive&mdash;they can be dead,
and they can be foreign.  No restrictions.

   <p><a name="index-nnkiboze_002ddirectory-2456"></a>The generation of an <code>nnkiboze</code> group means writing two files in
<code>nnkiboze-directory</code>, which is <samp><span class="file">~/News/kiboze/</span></samp> by default. 
One contains the <acronym>NOV</acronym> header lines for all the articles in
the group, and the other is an additional <samp><span class="file">.newsrc</span></samp> file to store
information on what groups have been searched through to find
component articles.

   <p>Articles marked as read in the <code>nnkiboze</code> group will have
their <acronym>NOV</acronym> lines removed from the <acronym>NOV</acronym> file.
