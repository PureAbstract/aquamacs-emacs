<h3 class="section">5.7 Drafts</h3>

<p><a name="index-drafts-1902"></a>
If you are writing a message (mail or news) and suddenly remember that
you have a steak in the oven (or some pesto in the food processor, you
craaazy vegetarians), you'll probably wish there was a method to save
the message you are writing so that you can continue editing it some
other day, and send it when you feel its finished.

   <p>Well, don't worry about it.  Whenever you start composing a message of
some sort using the Gnus mail and post commands, the buffer you get will
automatically associate to an article in a special <dfn>draft</dfn> group. 
If you save the buffer the normal way (<kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>, for instance), the
article will be saved there.  (Auto-save files also go to the draft
group.)

   <p><a name="index-nndraft-1903"></a><a name="index-nndraft_002ddirectory-1904"></a>The draft group is a special group (which is implemented as an
<code>nndraft</code> group, if you absolutely have to know) called
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nndraft:drafts</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The variable <code>nndraft-directory</code> says where
<code>nndraft</code> is to store its files.  What makes this group special is
that you can't tick any articles in it or mark any articles as
read&mdash;all articles in the group are permanently unread.

   <p>If the group doesn't exist, it will be created and you'll be subscribed
to it.  The only way to make it disappear from the Group buffer is to
unsubscribe it.  The special properties of the draft group comes from
a group property (see <a href="Group-Parameters.html#Group-Parameters">Group Parameters</a>), and if lost the group
behaves like any other group.  This means the commands below will not
be available.  To restore the special properties of the group, the
simplest way is to kill the group, using <kbd>C-k</kbd>, and restart
Gnus.  The group is automatically created again with the
correct parameters.  The content of the group is not lost.

<!-- @findex gnus-dissociate-buffer-from-draft -->

<!-- @kindex C-c M-d (Post) -->
<!-- @findex gnus-associate-buffer-with-draft -->
<!-- @kindex C-c C-d (Mail) -->
<!-- @kindex C-c C-d (Post) -->
<!-- If you're writing some super-secret message that you later want to -->
<!-- encode with PGP before sending, you may wish to turn the auto-saving -->
<!-- (and association with the draft group) off.  You never know who might be -->
<!-- interested in reading all your extremely valuable and terribly horrible -->
<!-- and interesting secrets.  The @kbd{C-c M-d} -->
<!-- (@code{gnus-dissociate-buffer-from-draft}) command does that for you. -->
<!-- If you change your mind and want to turn the auto-saving back on again, -->
<!-- @kbd{C-c C-d} (@code{gnus-associate-buffer-with-draft} does that. -->
<!-- @vindex gnus-use-draft -->
<!-- To leave association with the draft group off by default, set -->
<!-- @code{gnus-use-draft} to @code{nil}.  It is @code{t} by default. -->
   <p><a name="index-gnus_002ddraft_002dedit_002dmessage-1905"></a><a name="index-D-e-_0028Draft_0029-1906"></a>When you want to continue editing the article, you simply enter the
draft group and push <kbd>D e</kbd> (<code>gnus-draft-edit-message</code>) to do
that.  You will be placed in a buffer where you left off.

   <p>Rejected articles will also be put in this draft group (see <a href="Rejected-Articles.html#Rejected-Articles">Rejected Articles</a>).

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002ddraft_002dsend_002dall_002dmessages-1907"></a><a name="index-D-s-_0028Draft_0029-1908"></a><a name="index-gnus_002ddraft_002dsend_002dmessage-1909"></a><a name="index-D-S-_0028Draft_0029-1910"></a>If you have lots of rejected messages you want to post (or mail) without
doing further editing, you can use the <kbd>D s</kbd> command
(<code>gnus-draft-send-message</code>).  This command understands the
process/prefix convention (see <a href="Process_002fPrefix.html#Process_002fPrefix">Process/Prefix</a>).  The <kbd>D S</kbd>
command (<code>gnus-draft-send-all-messages</code>) will ship off all messages
in the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-gnus_002ddraft_002dtoggle_002dsending-1911"></a><a name="index-D-t-_0028Draft_0029-1912"></a>If you have some messages that you wish not to send, you can use the
<kbd>D t</kbd> (<code>gnus-draft-toggle-sending</code>) command to mark the message
as unsendable.  This is a toggling command.

   <p>Finally, if you want to delete a draft, use the normal <kbd>B DEL</kbd>
command (see <a href="Mail-Group-Commands.html#Mail-Group-Commands">Mail Group Commands</a>).
