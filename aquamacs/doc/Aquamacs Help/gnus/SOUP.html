<h4 class="subsection">6.6.4 SOUP</h4>

<p><a name="index-SOUP-2407"></a><a name="index-offline-2408"></a>
In the PC world people often talk about &ldquo;offline&rdquo; newsreaders.  These
are thingies that are combined reader/news transport monstrosities. 
With built-in modem programs.  Yecchh!

   <p>Of course, us Unix Weenie types of human beans use things like
<code>uucp</code> and, like, <code>nntpd</code> and set up proper news and mail
transport things like Ghod intended.  And then we just use normal
newsreaders.

   <p>However, it can sometimes be convenient to do something that's a bit
easier on the brain if you have a very slow modem, and you're not really
that interested in doing things properly.

   <p>A file format called <span class="sc">soup</span> has been developed for transporting news
and mail from servers to home machines and back again.  It can be a bit
fiddly.

   <p>First some terminology:

     <dl>
<dt><dfn>server</dfn><dd>This is the machine that is connected to the outside world and where you
get news and/or mail from.

     <br><dt><dfn>home machine</dfn><dd>This is the machine that you want to do the actual reading and responding
on.  It is typically not connected to the rest of the world in any way.

     <br><dt><dfn>packet</dfn><dd>Something that contains messages and/or commands.  There are two kinds
of packets:

          <dl>
<dt><dfn>message packets</dfn><dd>These are packets made at the server, and typically contain lots of
messages for you to read.  These are called <samp><span class="file">SoupoutX.tgz</span></samp> by
default, where <var>x</var> is a number.

          <br><dt><dfn>response packets</dfn><dd>These are packets made at the home machine, and typically contains
replies that you've written.  These are called <samp><span class="file">SoupinX.tgz</span></samp> by
default, where <var>x</var> is a number.

     </dl>

   </dl>

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>You log in on the server and create a <span class="sc">soup</span> packet.  You can either
use a dedicated <span class="sc">soup</span> thingie (like the <code>awk</code> program), or you
can use Gnus to create the packet with its <span class="sc">soup</span> commands (<kbd>O
s</kbd> and/or <kbd>G s b</kbd>; and then <kbd>G s p</kbd>) (see <a href="SOUP-Commands.html#SOUP-Commands">SOUP Commands</a>).

     <li>You transfer the packet home.  Rail, boat, car or modem will do fine.

     <li>You put the packet in your home directory.

     <li>You fire up Gnus on your home machine using the <code>nnsoup</code> back end as
the native or secondary server.

     <li>You read articles and mail and answer and followup to the things you
want (see <a href="SOUP-Replies.html#SOUP-Replies">SOUP Replies</a>).

     <li>You do the <kbd>G s r</kbd> command to pack these replies into a <span class="sc">soup</span>
packet.

     <li>You transfer this packet to the server.

     <li>You use Gnus to mail this packet out with the <kbd>G s s</kbd> command.

     <li>You then repeat until you die.

        </ol>

   <p>So you basically have a bipartite system&mdash;you use <code>nnsoup</code> for
reading and Gnus for packing/sending these <span class="sc">soup</span> packets.
