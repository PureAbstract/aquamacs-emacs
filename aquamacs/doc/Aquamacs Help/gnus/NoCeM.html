<h3 class="section">8.12 NoCeM</h3>

<p><a name="index-nocem-2790"></a><a name="index-spam-2791"></a>
<dfn>Spamming</dfn> is posting the same article lots and lots of times. 
Spamming is bad.  Spamming is evil.

   <p>Spamming is usually canceled within a day or so by various anti-spamming
agencies.  These agencies usually also send out <dfn>NoCeM</dfn> messages. 
NoCeM is pronounced &ldquo;no see-'em&rdquo;, and means what the name
implies&mdash;these are messages that make the offending articles, like, go
away.

   <p>What use are these NoCeM messages if the articles are canceled anyway? 
Some sites do not honor cancel messages and some sites just honor cancels
from a select few people.  Then you may wish to make use of the NoCeM
messages, which are distributed in the newsgroups
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">news.lists.filters</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">alt.nocem.misc</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.

   <p>Gnus can read and parse the messages in this group automatically, and
this will make spam disappear.

   <p>There are some variables to customize, of course:

     <dl>
<dt><code>gnus-use-nocem</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002duse_002dnocem-2792"></a>Set this variable to <code>t</code> to set the ball rolling.  It is <code>nil</code>
by default.

     <p>You can also set this variable to a positive number as a group level. 
In that case, Gnus scans NoCeM messages when checking new news if this
value is not exceeding a group level that you specify as the prefix
argument to some commands, e.g. <code>gnus</code>,
<code>gnus-group-get-new-news</code>, etc.  Otherwise, Gnus does not scan
NoCeM messages if you specify a group level that is smaller than this
value to those commands.  For example, if you use 1 or 2 on the mail
groups and the levels on the news groups remain the default, 3 is the
best choice.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-nocem-groups</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dnocem_002dgroups-2793"></a>Gnus will look for NoCeM messages in the groups in this list.  The
default is
     <pre class="lisp">          ("news.lists.filters" "alt.nocem.misc")
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>gnus-nocem-issuers</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dnocem_002dissuers-2794"></a>There are many people issuing NoCeM messages.  This list says what
people you want to listen to.  The default is:

     <pre class="lisp">          ("Adri Verhoef"
           "alba-nocem@albasani.net"
           "bleachbot@httrack.com"
           "news@arcor-online.net"
           "news@uni-berlin.de"
           "nocem@arcor.de"
           "pgpmoose@killfile.org"
           "xjsppl@gmx.de")
</pre>
     <p>Known despammers that you can put in this list are listed at<br>
<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~rosalind/nocemreg/nocemreg.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~rosalind/nocemreg/nocemreg.html</a>.

     <p>You do not have to heed NoCeM messages from all these people&mdash;just the
ones you want to listen to.  You also don't have to accept all NoCeM
messages from the people you like.  Each NoCeM message has a <dfn>type</dfn>
header that gives the message a (more or less, usually less) rigorous
definition.  Common types are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spew</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mmf</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">binary</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">troll</span></samp>&rsquo;.  To specify this, you have to use
<code>(</code><var>issuer</var> <var>conditions</var><code> ...)</code> elements in the list. 
Each condition is either a string (which is a regexp that matches types
you want to use) or a list on the form <code>(not </code><var>string</var><code>)</code>, where
<var>string</var> is a regexp that matches types you don't want to use.

     <p>For instance, if you want all NoCeM messages from Chris Lewis except his
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">troll</span></samp>&rsquo; messages, you'd say:

     <pre class="lisp">          ("clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca" ".*" (not "troll"))
</pre>
     <p>On the other hand, if you just want nothing but his &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spam</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">spew</span></samp>&rsquo; messages, you'd say:

     <pre class="lisp">          ("clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca" (not ".*") "spew" "spam")
</pre>
     <p>The specs are applied left-to-right.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-nocem-verifyer</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dnocem_002dverifyer-2795"></a><a name="index-gnus_002dnocem_002depg_002dverify-2796"></a><a name="index-pgg_002dverify-2797"></a>This should be a function for verifying that the NoCeM issuer is who she
says she is.  This variable defaults to <code>gnus-nocem-epg-verify</code> if
EasyPG is available, otherwise defaults to <code>pgg-verify</code>.  The
function should return non-<code>nil</code> if the verification is successful,
otherwise (including the case the NoCeM message was not signed) should
return <code>nil</code>.  If this is too slow and you don't care for
verification (which may be dangerous), you can set this variable to
<code>nil</code>.

     <p>Formerly the default was <code>mc-verify</code>, which is a Mailcrypt
function.  While you can still use it, you can change it into
<code>gnus-nocem-epg-verify</code> or <code>pgg-verify</code> running with GnuPG if
you are willing to add the <acronym>PGP</acronym> public keys to GnuPG's keyring.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-nocem-directory</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dnocem_002ddirectory-2798"></a>This is where Gnus will store its NoCeM cache files.  The default is<br>
<samp><span class="file">~/News/NoCeM/</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-nocem-expiry-wait</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dnocem_002dexpiry_002dwait-2799"></a>The number of days before removing old NoCeM entries from the cache. 
The default is 15.  If you make it shorter Gnus will be faster, but you
might then see old spam.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-nocem-check-from</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dnocem_002dcheck_002dfrom-2800"></a>Non-<code>nil</code> means check for valid issuers in message bodies. 
Otherwise don't bother fetching articles unless their author matches a
valid issuer; that is much faster if you are selective about the
issuers.

     <br><dt><code>gnus-nocem-check-article-limit</code><dd><a name="index-gnus_002dnocem_002dcheck_002darticle_002dlimit-2801"></a>If non-<code>nil</code>, the maximum number of articles to check in any NoCeM
group.  <code>nil</code> means no restriction.  NoCeM groups can be huge and
very slow to process.

   </dl>

   <p>Using NoCeM could potentially be a memory hog.  If you have many living
(i. e., subscribed or unsubscribed groups), your Emacs process will grow
big.  If this is a problem, you should kill off all (or most) of your
unsubscribed groups (see <a href="Subscription-Commands.html#Subscription-Commands">Subscription Commands</a>).
