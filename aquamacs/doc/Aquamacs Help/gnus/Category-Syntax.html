<h5 class="subsubsection">6.9.2.1 Category Syntax</h5>

<p>A category consists of a name, the list of groups belonging to the
category, and a number of optional parameters that override the
customizable variables.  The complete list of agent parameters are
listed below.

   <p><a name="index-Agent-Parameters-2320"></a>
     <dl>
<dt><code>agent-groups</code><dd>The list of groups that are in this category.

     <br><dt><code>agent-predicate</code><dd>A predicate which (generally) gives a rough outline of which articles
are eligible for downloading; and

     <br><dt><code>agent-score</code><dd>a score rule which (generally) gives you a finer granularity when
deciding what articles to download.  (Note that this <dfn>download
score</dfn> is not necessarily related to normal scores.)

     <br><dt><code>agent-enable-expiration</code><dd>a boolean indicating whether the agent should expire old articles in
this group.  Most groups should be expired to conserve disk space.  In
fact, its probably safe to say that the gnus.* hierarchy contains the
only groups that should not be expired.

     <br><dt><code>agent-days-until-old</code><dd>an integer indicating the number of days that the agent should wait
before deciding that a read article is safe to expire.

     <br><dt><code>agent-low-score</code><dd>an integer that overrides the value of <code>gnus-agent-low-score</code>.

     <br><dt><code>agent-high-score</code><dd>an integer that overrides the value of <code>gnus-agent-high-score</code>.

     <br><dt><code>agent-short-article</code><dd>an integer that overrides the value of
<code>gnus-agent-short-article</code>.

     <br><dt><code>agent-long-article</code><dd>an integer that overrides the value of <code>gnus-agent-long-article</code>.

     <br><dt><code>agent-enable-undownloaded-faces</code><dd>a symbol indicating whether the summary buffer should display
undownloaded articles using the <code>gnus-summary-*-undownloaded-face</code>
faces.  Any symbol other than <code>nil</code> will enable the use of
undownloaded faces. 
</dl>

   <p>The name of a category can not be changed once the category has been
created.

   <p>Each category maintains a list of groups that are exclusive members of
that category.  The exclusivity rule is automatically enforced, add a
group to a new category and it is automatically removed from its old
category.

   <p>A predicate in its simplest form can be a single predicate such as
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.  These two will download every available
article or nothing respectively.  In the case of these two special
predicates an additional score rule is superfluous.

   <p>Predicates of <code>high</code> or <code>low</code> download articles in respect of
their scores in relationship to <code>gnus-agent-high-score</code> and
<code>gnus-agent-low-score</code> as described below.

   <p>To gain even finer control of what is to be regarded eligible for
download a predicate can consist of a number of predicates with logical
operators sprinkled in between.

   <p>Perhaps some examples are in order.

   <p>Here's a simple predicate.  (It's the default predicate, in fact, used
for all groups that don't belong to any other category.)

<pre class="lisp">     short
</pre>
   <p>Quite simple, eh?  This predicate is true if and only if the article is
short (for some value of &ldquo;short&rdquo;).

   <p>Here's a more complex predicate:

<pre class="lisp">     (or high
         (and
          (not low)
          (not long)))
</pre>
   <p>This means that an article should be downloaded if it has a high score,
or if the score is not low and the article is not long.  You get the
drift.

   <p>The available logical operators are <code>or</code>, <code>and</code> and
<code>not</code>.  (If you prefer, you can use the more &ldquo;C&rdquo;-ish operators
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;, <code>&amp;</code> and <code>!</code> instead.)

   <p>The following predicates are pre-defined, but if none of these fit what
you want to do, you can write your own.

   <p>When evaluating each of these predicates, the named constant will be
bound to the value determined by calling
<code>gnus-agent-find-parameter</code> on the appropriate parameter.  For
example, gnus-agent-short-article will be bound to
<code>(gnus-agent-find-parameter group 'agent-short-article)</code>.  This
means that you can specify a predicate in your category then tune that
predicate to individual groups.

     <dl>
<dt><code>short</code><dd>True if the article is shorter than <code>gnus-agent-short-article</code>
lines; default 100.

     <br><dt><code>long</code><dd>True if the article is longer than <code>gnus-agent-long-article</code>
lines; default 200.

     <br><dt><code>low</code><dd>True if the article has a download score less than
<code>gnus-agent-low-score</code>; default 0.

     <br><dt><code>high</code><dd>True if the article has a download score greater than
<code>gnus-agent-high-score</code>; default 0.

     <br><dt><code>spam</code><dd>True if the Gnus Agent guesses that the article is spam.  The
heuristics may change over time, but at present it just computes a
checksum and sees whether articles match.

     <br><dt><code>true</code><dd>Always true.

     <br><dt><code>false</code><dd>Always false. 
</dl>

   <p>If you want to create your own predicate function, here's what you have
to know:  The functions are called with no parameters, but the
<code>gnus-headers</code> and <code>gnus-score</code> dynamic variables are bound to
useful values.

   <p>For example, you could decide that you don't want to download articles
that were posted more than a certain number of days ago (e.g. posted
more than <code>gnus-agent-expire-days</code> ago) you might write a function
something along the lines of the following:

<pre class="lisp">     (defun my-article-old-p ()
       "Say whether an article is old."
       (&lt; (time-to-days (date-to-time (mail-header-date gnus-headers)))
          (- (time-to-days (current-time)) gnus-agent-expire-days)))
</pre>
   <p>with the predicate then defined as:

<pre class="lisp">     (not my-article-old-p)
</pre>
   <p>or you could append your predicate to the predefined
<code>gnus-category-predicate-alist</code> in your <samp><span class="file">~/.gnus.el</span></samp> or
wherever.

<pre class="lisp">     (require 'gnus-agent)
     (setq  gnus-category-predicate-alist
       (append gnus-category-predicate-alist
              '((old . my-article-old-p))))
</pre>
   <p>and simply specify your predicate as:

<pre class="lisp">     (not old)
</pre>
   <p>If/when using something like the above, be aware that there are many
misconfigured systems/mailers out there and so an article's date is not
always a reliable indication of when it was posted.  Hell, some people
just don't give a damn.

   <p>The above predicates apply to <em>all</em> the groups which belong to the
category.  However, if you wish to have a specific predicate for an
individual group within a category, or you're just too lazy to set up a
new category, you can enter a group's individual predicate in its group
parameters like so:

<pre class="lisp">     (agent-predicate . short)
</pre>
   <p>This is the group/topic parameter equivalent of the agent category default. 
Note that when specifying a single word predicate like this, the
<code>agent-predicate</code> specification must be in dotted pair notation.

   <p>The equivalent of the longer example from above would be:

<pre class="lisp">     (agent-predicate or high (and (not low) (not long)))
</pre>
   <p>The outer parenthesis required in the category specification are not
entered here as, not being in dotted pair notation, the value of the
predicate is assumed to be a list.

   <p>Now, the syntax of the download score is the same as the syntax of
normal score files, except that all elements that require actually
seeing the article itself are verboten.  This means that only the
following headers can be scored on: <code>Subject</code>, <code>From</code>,
<code>Date</code>, <code>Message-ID</code>, <code>References</code>, <code>Chars</code>,
<code>Lines</code>, and <code>Xref</code>.

   <p>As with predicates, the specification of the <code>download score rule</code>
to use in respect of a group can be in either the category definition if
it's to be applicable to all groups in therein, or a group's parameters
if it's to be specific to that group.

   <p>In both of these places the <code>download score rule</code> can take one of
three forms:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Score rule

     <p>This has the same syntax as a normal Gnus score file except only a
subset of scoring keywords are available as mentioned above.

     <p>example:

          <ul>
<li>Category specification

          <pre class="lisp">               (("from"
                      ("Lars Ingebrigtsen" 1000000 nil s))
               ("lines"
                      (500 -100 nil &lt;)))
</pre>
          <li>Group/Topic Parameter specification

          <pre class="lisp">               (agent-score ("from"
                                  ("Lars Ingebrigtsen" 1000000 nil s))
                            ("lines"
                                  (500 -100 nil &lt;)))
</pre>
          <p>Again, note the omission of the outermost parenthesis here. 
</ul>

     <li>Agent score file

     <p>These score files must <em>only</em> contain the permitted scoring
keywords stated above.

     <p>example:

          <ul>
<li>Category specification

          <pre class="lisp">               ("~/News/agent.SCORE")
</pre>
          <p>or perhaps

          <pre class="lisp">               ("~/News/agent.SCORE" "~/News/agent.group.SCORE")
</pre>
          <li>Group Parameter specification

          <pre class="lisp">               (agent-score "~/News/agent.SCORE")
</pre>
          <p>Additional score files can be specified as above.  Need I say anything
about parenthesis? 
</ul>

     <li>Use <code>normal</code> score files

     <p>If you don't want to maintain two sets of scoring rules for a group, and
your desired <code>downloading</code> criteria for a group are the same as your
<code>reading</code> criteria then you can tell the agent to refer to your
<code>normal</code> score files when deciding what to download.

     <p>These directives in either the category definition or a group's
parameters will cause the agent to read in all the applicable score
files for a group, <em>filtering out</em> those sections that do not
relate to one of the permitted subset of scoring keywords.

          <ul>
<li>Category Specification

          <pre class="lisp">               file
</pre>
          <li>Group Parameter specification

          <pre class="lisp">               (agent-score . file)
</pre>
          </ul>
     </ol>

   </body></html>
