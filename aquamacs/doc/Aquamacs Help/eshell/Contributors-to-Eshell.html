<h3 class="section">1.1 Contributors to Eshell</h3>

<p><a name="index-contributors-3"></a><a name="index-authors-4"></a>
Contributions to Eshell are welcome.  I have limited time to work on
this project, but I will gladly add any code you contribute to me to
this package.

   <p>The following persons have made contributions to Eshell.

     <ul>
<li>Eli Zaretskii made it possible for Eshell to run without requiring
asynchronous subprocess support.  This is important for MS-DOS, which
does not have such support.

     <li>Miles Bader contributed many fixes during the port to Emacs 21.

     <li>Stefan Monnier fixed the things which bothered him, which of course made
things better for all.

     <li>Gerd Moellmann also helped to contribute bug fixes during the initial
integration with Emacs 21.

     <li>Alex Schroeder contributed code for interactively querying the user
before overwriting files.

     <li>Sudish Joseph helped with some XEmacs compatibility issues. 
</ul>

   <p>Apart from these, a lot of people have sent suggestions, ideas,
requests, bug reports and encouragement.  Thanks a lot!  Without you
there would be no new releases of Eshell.
