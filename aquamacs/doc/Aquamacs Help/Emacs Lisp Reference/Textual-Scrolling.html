<h3 class="section">28.12 Textual Scrolling</h3>

<p><a name="index-textual-scrolling-2132"></a><a name="index-scrolling-textually-2133"></a>
  <dfn>Textual scrolling</dfn> means moving the text up or down through a
window.  It works by changing the value of the window's display-start
location.  It may also change the value of <code>window-point</code> to keep
point on the screen.

   <p>Textual scrolling was formerly called &ldquo;vertical scrolling,&rdquo; but we
changed its name to distinguish it from the new vertical fractional
scrolling feature (see <a href="Vertical-Scrolling.html#Vertical-Scrolling">Vertical Scrolling</a>).

   <p>In the commands <code>scroll-up</code> and <code>scroll-down</code>, the directions
&ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo; refer to the motion of the text in the buffer at which
you are looking through the window.  Imagine that the text is
written on a long roll of paper and that the scrolling commands move the
paper up and down.  Thus, if you are looking at text in the middle of a
buffer and repeatedly call <code>scroll-down</code>, you will eventually see
the beginning of the buffer.

   <p>Some people have urged that the opposite convention be used: they
imagine that the window moves over text that remains in place.  Then
&ldquo;down&rdquo; commands would take you to the end of the buffer.  This view is
more consistent with the actual relationship between windows and the
text in the buffer, but it is less like what the user sees.  The
position of a window on the terminal does not move, and short scrolling
commands clearly move the text up or down on the screen.  We have chosen
names that fit the user's point of view.

   <p>The textual scrolling functions (aside from
<code>scroll-other-window</code>) have unpredictable results if the current
buffer is different from the buffer that is displayed in the selected
window.  See <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>.

   <p>If the window contains a row which is taller than the height of the
window (for example in the presence of a large image), the scroll
functions will adjust the window's vertical scroll position to scroll
the partially visible row.  To disable this feature, Lisp code may bind
the variable <code>auto-window-vscroll</code> to <code>nil</code> (see <a href="Vertical-Scrolling.html#Vertical-Scrolling">Vertical Scrolling</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>scroll-up</b><var> &amp;optional count<a name="index-scroll_002dup-2134"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scrolls the text in the selected window upward
<var>count</var> lines.  If <var>count</var> is negative, scrolling is actually
downward.

        <p>If <var>count</var> is <code>nil</code> (or omitted), then the length of scroll
is <code>next-screen-context-lines</code> lines less than the usable height of
the window (not counting its mode line).

        <p><code>scroll-up</code> returns <code>nil</code>, unless it gets an error
because it can't scroll any further. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>scroll-down</b><var> &amp;optional count<a name="index-scroll_002ddown-2135"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scrolls the text in the selected window downward
<var>count</var> lines.  If <var>count</var> is negative, scrolling is actually
upward.

        <p>If <var>count</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, then the length of the scroll
is <code>next-screen-context-lines</code> lines less than the usable height of
the window (not counting its mode line).

        <p><code>scroll-down</code> returns <code>nil</code>, unless it gets an error because
it can't scroll any further. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>scroll-other-window</b><var> &amp;optional count<a name="index-scroll_002dother_002dwindow-2136"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function scrolls the text in another window upward <var>count</var>
lines.  Negative values of <var>count</var>, or <code>nil</code>, are handled
as in <code>scroll-up</code>.

        <p>You can specify which buffer to scroll by setting the variable
<code>other-window-scroll-buffer</code> to a buffer.  If that buffer isn't
already displayed, <code>scroll-other-window</code> displays it in some
window.

        <p>When the selected window is the minibuffer, the next window is normally
the one at the top left corner.  You can specify a different window to
scroll, when the minibuffer is selected, by setting the variable
<code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code>.  This variable has no effect when any
other window is selected.  When it is non-<code>nil</code> and the
minibuffer is selected, it takes precedence over
<code>other-window-scroll-buffer</code>.  See <a href="Definition-of-minibuffer_002dscroll_002dwindow.html#Definition-of-minibuffer_002dscroll_002dwindow">Definition of minibuffer-scroll-window</a>.

        <p>When the minibuffer is active, it is the next window if the selected
window is the one at the bottom right corner.  In this case,
<code>scroll-other-window</code> attempts to scroll the minibuffer.  If the
minibuffer contains just one line, it has nowhere to scroll to, so the
line reappears after the echo area momentarily displays the message
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Beginning of buffer</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>other-window-scroll-buffer</b><var><a name="index-other_002dwindow_002dscroll_002dbuffer-2137"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, it tells <code>scroll-other-window</code>
which buffer's window to scroll. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>scroll-margin</b><var><a name="index-scroll_002dmargin-2138"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This option specifies the size of the scroll margin&mdash;a minimum number
of lines between point and the top or bottom of a window.  Whenever
point gets within this many lines of the top or bottom of the window,
redisplay scrolls the text automatically (if possible) to move point
out of the margin, closer to the center of the window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>scroll-conservatively</b><var><a name="index-scroll_002dconservatively-2139"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable controls how scrolling is done automatically when point
moves off the screen (or into the scroll margin).  If the value is a
positive integer <var>n</var>, then redisplay scrolls the text up to
<var>n</var> lines in either direction, if that will bring point back into
proper view.  This behavior is called <dfn>conservative scrolling</dfn>. 
Otherwise, scrolling happens in the usual way, under the control of
other variables such as <code>scroll-up-aggressively</code> and
<code>scroll-down-aggressively</code>.

        <p>The default value is zero, which means that conservative scrolling
never happens. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>scroll-down-aggressively</b><var><a name="index-scroll_002ddown_002daggressively-2140"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable should be either <code>nil</code> or a fraction
<var>f</var> between 0 and 1.  If it is a fraction, that specifies where on
the screen to put point when scrolling down.  More precisely, when a
window scrolls down because point is above the window start, the new
start position is chosen to put point <var>f</var> part of the window
height from the top.  The larger <var>f</var>, the more aggressive the
scrolling.

        <p>A value of <code>nil</code> is equivalent to .5, since its effect is to center
point.  This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any
fashion. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>scroll-up-aggressively</b><var><a name="index-scroll_002dup_002daggressively-2141"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Likewise, for scrolling up.  The value, <var>f</var>, specifies how far
point should be placed from the bottom of the window; thus, as with
<code>scroll-up-aggressively</code>, a larger value scrolls more aggressively. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>scroll-step</b><var><a name="index-scroll_002dstep-2142"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is an older variant of <code>scroll-conservatively</code>. 
The difference is that if its value is <var>n</var>, that permits scrolling
only by precisely <var>n</var> lines, not a smaller number.  This feature
does not work with <code>scroll-margin</code>.  The default value is zero. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>scroll-preserve-screen-position</b><var><a name="index-scroll_002dpreserve_002dscreen_002dposition-2143"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this option is <code>t</code>, scrolling which would move the current
point position out of the window chooses the new position of point
so that the vertical position of the cursor is unchanged, if possible.

        <p>If it is non-<code>nil</code> and not <code>t</code>, then the scrolling functions
always preserve the vertical position of point, if possible. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>next-screen-context-lines</b><var><a name="index-next_002dscreen_002dcontext_002dlines-2144"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the number of lines of continuity to
retain when scrolling by full screens.  For example, <code>scroll-up</code>
with an argument of <code>nil</code> scrolls so that this many lines at the
bottom of the window appear instead at the top.  The default value is
<code>2</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>recenter</b><var> &amp;optional count<a name="index-recenter-2145"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-centering-point-2146"></a>This function scrolls the text in the selected window so that point is
displayed at a specified vertical position within the window.  It does
not &ldquo;move point&rdquo; with respect to the text.

        <p>If <var>count</var> is a nonnegative number, that puts the line containing
point <var>count</var> lines down from the top of the window.  If
<var>count</var> is a negative number, then it counts upward from the
bottom of the window, so that &minus;1 stands for the last usable
line in the window.  If <var>count</var> is a non-<code>nil</code> list, then it
stands for the line in the middle of the window.

        <p>If <var>count</var> is <code>nil</code>, <code>recenter</code> puts the line containing
point in the middle of the window, then clears and redisplays the entire
selected frame.

        <p>When <code>recenter</code> is called interactively, <var>count</var> is the raw
prefix argument.  Thus, typing <kbd>C-u</kbd> as the prefix sets the
<var>count</var> to a non-<code>nil</code> list, while typing <kbd>C-u 4</kbd> sets
<var>count</var> to 4, which positions the current line four lines from the
top.

        <p>With an argument of zero, <code>recenter</code> positions the current line at
the top of the window.  This action is so handy that some people make a
separate key binding to do this.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          (defun line-to-top-of-window ()
            "Scroll current line to top of window.
          Replaces three keystroke sequence C-u 0 C-l."
            (interactive)
            (recenter 0))
          
          (global-set-key [kp-multiply] 'line-to-top-of-window)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
