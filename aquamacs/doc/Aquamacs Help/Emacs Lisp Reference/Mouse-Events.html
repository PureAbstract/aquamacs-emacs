<h4 class="subsection">21.7.3 Mouse Events</h4>

<p>Emacs supports four kinds of mouse events: click events, drag events,
button-down events, and motion events.  All mouse events are represented
as lists.  The <span class="sc">car</span> of the list is the event type; this says which
mouse button was involved, and which modifier keys were used with it. 
The event type can also distinguish double or triple button presses
(see <a href="Repeat-Events.html#Repeat-Events">Repeat Events</a>).  The rest of the list elements give position
and time information.

   <p>For key lookup, only the event type matters: two events of the same type
necessarily run the same command.  The command can access the full
values of these events using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">e</span></samp>&rsquo; interactive code. 
See <a href="Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes">Interactive Codes</a>.

   <p>A key sequence that starts with a mouse event is read using the keymaps
of the buffer in the window that the mouse was in, not the current
buffer.  This does not imply that clicking in a window selects that
window or its buffer&mdash;that is entirely under the control of the command
binding of the key sequence.
