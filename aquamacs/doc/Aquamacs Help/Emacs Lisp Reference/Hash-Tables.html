<h2 class="chapter">7 Hash Tables</h2>

<p><a name="index-hash-tables-447"></a><a name="index-lookup-tables-448"></a>
  A hash table is a very fast kind of lookup table, somewhat like an
alist (see <a href="Association-Lists.html#Association-Lists">Association Lists</a>) in that it maps keys to
corresponding values.  It differs from an alist in these ways:

     <ul>
<li>Lookup in a hash table is extremely fast for large tables&mdash;in fact, the
time required is essentially <em>independent</em> of how many elements are
stored in the table.  For smaller tables (a few tens of elements)
alists may still be faster because hash tables have a more-or-less
constant overhead.

     <li>The correspondences in a hash table are in no particular order.

     <li>There is no way to share structure between two hash tables,
the way two alists can share a common tail. 
</ul>

   <p>Emacs Lisp provides a general-purpose hash table data type, along
with a series of functions for operating on them.  Hash tables have a
special printed representation, which consists of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#s</span></samp>&rsquo; followed
by a list specifying the hash table properties and contents. 
See <a href="Creating-Hash.html#Creating-Hash">Creating Hash</a>.  (Note that the term &ldquo;hash notation&rdquo;, which
refers to the initial &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; character used in the printed
representations of objects with no read representation, has nothing to
do with the term &ldquo;hash table&rdquo;.  See <a href="Printed-Representation.html#Printed-Representation">Printed Representation</a>.)

   <p>Obarrays are also a kind of hash table, but they are a different type
of object and are used only for recording interned symbols
(see <a href="Creating-Symbols.html#Creating-Symbols">Creating Symbols</a>).
