<h3 class="section">18.5 Debugging Problems in Compilation</h3>

<p><a name="index-debugging-byte-compilation-problems-1023"></a>
  When an error happens during byte compilation, it is normally due to
invalid syntax in the program you are compiling.  The compiler prints a
suitable error message in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*Compile-Log*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, and then
stops.  The message may state a function name in which the error was
found, or it may not.  Either way, here is how to find out where in the
file the error occurred.

   <p>What you should do is switch to the buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&nbsp;*Compiler&nbsp;Input*</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->. 
(Note that the buffer name starts with a space, so it does not show
up in <kbd>M-x list-buffers</kbd>.)  This buffer contains the program being
compiled, and point shows how far the byte compiler was able to read.

   <p>If the error was due to invalid Lisp syntax, point shows exactly where
the invalid syntax was <em>detected</em>.  The cause of the error is not
necessarily near by!  Use the techniques in the previous section to find
the error.

   <p>If the error was detected while compiling a form that had been read
successfully, then point is located at the end of the form.  In this
case, this technique can't localize the error precisely, but can still
show you which function to check.
