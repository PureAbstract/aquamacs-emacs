<h3 class="section">28.7 Displaying Buffers in Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-switching-to-a-buffer-2086"></a><a name="index-displaying-a-buffer-2087"></a>
  In this section we describe convenient functions that choose a window
automatically and use it to display a specified buffer.  These functions
can also split an existing window in certain circumstances.  We also
describe variables that parameterize the heuristics used for choosing a
window. 
See <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>, for
low-level primitives that give you more precise control.  All of these
functions work by calling <code>set-window-buffer</code>.

   <p>Do not use the functions in this section in order to make a buffer
current so that a Lisp program can access or modify it; they are too
drastic for that purpose, since they change the display of buffers in
windows, which would be gratuitous and surprise the user.  Instead, use
<code>set-buffer</code> and <code>save-current-buffer</code> (see <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>), which designate buffers as current for programmed access
without affecting the display of buffers in windows.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>switch-to-buffer</b><var> buffer-or-name &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer-2088"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>buffer-or-name</var> the current buffer, and also
displays the buffer in the selected window.  This means that a human can
see the buffer and subsequent keyboard commands will apply to it. 
Contrast this with <code>set-buffer</code>, which makes <var>buffer-or-name</var>
the current buffer but does not display it in the selected window;
see <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>.

        <p>If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is <code>nil</code>, <code>switch-to-buffer</code> chooses a
buffer using <code>other-buffer</code>.  If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is a string
that does not identify an existing buffer, then a new buffer by that
name is created.  The major mode for the new buffer is set according to
the variable <code>major-mode</code>; see <a href="Auto-Major-Mode.html#Auto-Major-Mode">Auto Major Mode</a>.

        <p>When the selected window is the minibuffer window or is strongly
dedicated to its buffer (see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>), this function calls
<code>pop-to-buffer</code> (see below) to display the buffer in some other
window.

        <p>Normally the specified buffer is put at the front of the buffer list
(both the selected frame's buffer list and the frame-independent buffer
list).  This affects the operation of <code>other-buffer</code>.  However, if
<var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this is not done.  See <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>.

        <p>The <code>switch-to-buffer</code> function is often used interactively, as
the binding of <kbd>C-x b</kbd>.  It is also used frequently in programs.  It
returns the buffer that it switched to. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The next two functions are similar to <code>switch-to-buffer</code>, except
for the described features.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>switch-to-buffer-other-window</b><var> buffer-or-name &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer_002dother_002dwindow-2089"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the buffer specified by <var>buffer-or-name</var> current
and displays it in a window not currently selected, using the function
<code>pop-to-buffer</code> (see below).

        <p>The currently selected window is absolutely never used to do the job. 
If the selected window already displays <var>buffer-or-name</var>, then it
continues to do so, but another window is nonetheless found to display
it in as well.

        <p>This function updates the buffer list just like <code>switch-to-buffer</code>
unless <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>pop-to-buffer</b><var> buffer-or-name &amp;optional other-window norecord<a name="index-pop_002dto_002dbuffer-2090"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command makes <var>buffer-or-name</var> the current buffer and switches
to it in some window, preferably not the window previously selected. 
The &ldquo;popped-to&rdquo; window becomes the selected window.  Its frame is
given the X server's focus, if possible; see <a href="Input-Focus.html#Input-Focus">Input Focus</a>.  The
return value is the buffer that was switched to.

        <p>If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is <code>nil</code>, that means to choose some other
buffer, but you don't specify which.  If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is a
string that does not name an existing buffer, a buffer by that name is
created.  The major mode for the new buffer is set according to the
variable <code>major-mode</code>.  See <a href="Auto-Major-Mode.html#Auto-Major-Mode">Auto Major Mode</a>.

        <p>If either of the variables <code>display-buffer-reuse-frames</code> or
<code>pop-up-frames</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>pop-to-buffer</code> looks for a
window in any visible frame already displaying the buffer; if there is
one, it selects and returns that window.  If no such window exists and
<code>pop-up-frames</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, it creates a new frame and
displays the buffer in it.  Otherwise, <code>pop-to-buffer</code> operates
entirely within the selected frame.  (If the selected frame has just a
minibuffer, <code>pop-to-buffer</code> operates within the most recently
selected frame that was not just a minibuffer.)

        <p>If the variable <code>pop-up-windows</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, windows may be
split to create a new window that is different from the original window. 
For details, see <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>.

        <p>If <var>other-window</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>pop-to-buffer</code> finds or
creates another window even if <var>buffer-or-name</var> is already visible
in the selected window.  Thus <var>buffer-or-name</var> could end up
displayed in two windows.  On the other hand, if <var>buffer-or-name</var> is
already displayed in the selected window and <var>other-window</var> is
<code>nil</code>, then the selected window is considered sufficient for
displaying <var>buffer-or-name</var>, so that nothing needs to be done.

        <p>All the variables that affect <code>display-buffer</code> affect
<code>pop-to-buffer</code> as well.  See <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>.

        <p>This function updates the buffer list just like <code>switch-to-buffer</code>
unless <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>replace-buffer-in-windows</b><var> &amp;optional buffer-or-name<a name="index-replace_002dbuffer_002din_002dwindows-2091"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function replaces <var>buffer-or-name</var> in all windows displaying
it with some other buffer.  It uses <code>other-buffer</code> to choose the
other buffer.  In the usual applications of this function, you
don't care which other buffer is used; you just want to make sure that
<var>buffer-or-name</var> is no longer displayed.

        <p>The argument <var>buffer-or-name</var> may be a buffer or the name of an
existing buffer and defaults to the current buffer.

        <p>If a window displaying <var>buffer-or-name</var> is dedicated
(see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>), and is not the only window on its frame,
that window is deleted.  If that window is the only window on its frame
and there are other frames left, the window's frame is deleted too.  If
there are no other frames left, some other buffer is displayed in that
window.

        <p>This function returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>
