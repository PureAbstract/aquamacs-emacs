<h3 class="section">4.1 String and Character Basics</h3>

<p>Characters are represented in Emacs Lisp as integers;
whether an integer is a character or not is determined only by how it is
used.  Thus, strings really contain integers.  See <a href="Character-Codes.html#Character-Codes">Character Codes</a>,
for details about character representation in Emacs.

   <p>The length of a string (like any array) is fixed, and cannot be
altered once the string exists.  Strings in Lisp are <em>not</em>
terminated by a distinguished character code.  (By contrast, strings in
C are terminated by a character with <acronym>ASCII</acronym> code 0.)

   <p>Since strings are arrays, and therefore sequences as well, you can
operate on them with the general array and sequence functions. 
(See <a href="Sequences-Arrays-Vectors.html#Sequences-Arrays-Vectors">Sequences Arrays Vectors</a>.)  For example, you can access or
change individual characters in a string using the functions <code>aref</code>
and <code>aset</code> (see <a href="Array-Functions.html#Array-Functions">Array Functions</a>).

   <p>There are two text representations for non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters in
Emacs strings (and in buffers): unibyte and multibyte (see <a href="Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">Text Representations</a>).  For most Lisp programming, you don't need to be
concerned with these two representations.

   <p>Sometimes key sequences are represented as unibyte strings.  When a
unibyte string is a key sequence, string elements in the range 128 to
255 represent meta characters (which are large integers) rather than
character codes in the range 128 to 255.  Strings cannot hold
characters that have the hyper, super or alt modifiers; they can hold
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters, but no other control characters. 
They do not distinguish case in <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control characters. 
If you want to store such characters in a sequence, such as a key
sequence, you must use a vector instead of a string.  See <a href="Character-Type.html#Character-Type">Character Type</a>, for more information about keyboard input characters.

   <p>Strings are useful for holding regular expressions.  You can also
match regular expressions against strings with <code>string-match</code>
(see <a href="Regexp-Search.html#Regexp-Search">Regexp Search</a>).  The functions <code>match-string</code>
(see <a href="Simple-Match-Data.html#Simple-Match-Data">Simple Match Data</a>) and <code>replace-match</code> (see <a href="Replacing-Match.html#Replacing-Match">Replacing Match</a>) are useful for decomposing and modifying strings after
matching regular expressions against them.

   <p>Like a buffer, a string can contain text properties for the characters
in it, as well as the characters themselves.  See <a href="Text-Properties.html#Text-Properties">Text Properties</a>. 
All the Lisp primitives that copy text from strings to buffers or other
strings also copy the properties of the characters being copied.

   <p>See <a href="Text.html#Text">Text</a>, for information about functions that display strings or
copy them into buffers.  See <a href="Character-Type.html#Character-Type">Character Type</a>, and <a href="String-Type.html#String-Type">String Type</a>,
for information about the syntax of characters and strings. 
See <a href="Non_002dASCII-Characters.html#Non_002dASCII-Characters">Non-ASCII Characters</a>, for functions to convert between text
representations and to encode and decode character codes.
