<h3 class="section">11.3 Local Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-binding-local-variables-584"></a><a name="index-local-variables-585"></a><a name="index-local-binding-586"></a><a name="index-global-binding-587"></a>
  Global variables have values that last until explicitly superseded
with new values.  Sometimes it is useful to create variable values that
exist temporarily&mdash;only until a certain part of the program finishes. 
These values are called <dfn>local</dfn>, and the variables so used are
called <dfn>local variables</dfn>.

   <p>For example, when a function is called, its argument variables receive
new local values that last until the function exits.  The <code>let</code>
special form explicitly establishes new local values for specified
variables; these last until exit from the <code>let</code> form.

   <p><a name="index-shadowing-of-variables-588"></a>  Establishing a local value saves away the variable's previous value
(or lack of one).  We say that the previous value is <dfn>shadowed</dfn>
and <dfn>not visible</dfn>.  Both global and local values may be shadowed
(see <a href="Scope.html#Scope">Scope</a>).  After the life span of the local value is over, the
previous value (or lack of one) is restored.

   <p>If you set a variable (such as with <code>setq</code>) while it is local,
this replaces the local value; it does not alter the global value, or
previous local values, that are shadowed.  To model this behavior, we
speak of a <dfn>local binding</dfn> of the variable as well as a local value.

   <p>The local binding is a conceptual place that holds a local value. 
Entering a function, or a special form such as <code>let</code>, creates the
local binding; exiting the function or the <code>let</code> removes the
local binding.  While the local binding lasts, the variable's value is
stored within it.  Using <code>setq</code> or <code>set</code> while there is a
local binding stores a different value into the local binding; it does
not create a new binding.

   <p>We also speak of the <dfn>global binding</dfn>, which is where
(conceptually) the global value is kept.

   <p><a name="index-current-binding-589"></a>  A variable can have more than one local binding at a time (for
example, if there are nested <code>let</code> forms that bind it).  In such a
case, the most recently created local binding that still exists is the
<dfn>current binding</dfn> of the variable.  (This rule is called
<dfn>dynamic scoping</dfn>; see <a href="Variable-Scoping.html#Variable-Scoping">Variable Scoping</a>.)  If there are no
local bindings, the variable's global binding is its current binding. 
We sometimes call the current binding the <dfn>most-local existing
binding</dfn>, for emphasis.  Ordinary evaluation of a symbol always returns
the value of its current binding.

   <p>The special forms <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code> exist to create
local bindings.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>let</b> (<var>bindings<small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-let-590"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form binds variables according to <var>bindings</var> and then
evaluates all of the <var>forms</var> in textual order.  The <code>let</code>-form
returns the value of the last form in <var>forms</var>.

        <p>Each of the <var>bindings</var> is either (i)&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> symbol, in which case
that symbol is bound to <code>nil</code>; or (ii)&nbsp;a<!-- /@w --> list of the form
<code>(</code><var>symbol</var> <var>value-form</var><code>)</code>, in which case <var>symbol</var> is
bound to the result of evaluating <var>value-form</var>.  If <var>value-form</var>
is omitted, <code>nil</code> is used.

        <p>All of the <var>value-form</var>s in <var>bindings</var> are evaluated in the
order they appear and <em>before</em> binding any of the symbols to them. 
Here is an example of this: <code>z</code> is bound to the old value of
<code>y</code>, which is 2, not the new value of <code>y</code>, which is 1.

     <pre class="example">          (setq y 2)
               &rArr; 2
          (let ((y 1)
                (z y))
            (list y z))
               &rArr; (1 2)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>let*</b> (<var>bindings<small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-let_002a-591"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form is like <code>let</code>, but it binds each variable right
after computing its local value, before computing the local value for
the next variable.  Therefore, an expression in <var>bindings</var> can
reasonably refer to the preceding symbols bound in this <code>let*</code>
form.  Compare the following example with the example above for
<code>let</code>.

     <pre class="example">          (setq y 2)
               &rArr; 2
          (let* ((y 1)
                 (z y))    ; <span class="roman">Use the just-established value of </span><code>y</code><span class="roman">.</span>
            (list y z))
               &rArr; (1 1)
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>Here is a complete list of the other facilities that create local
bindings:

     <ul>
<li>Function calls (see <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>).

     <li>Macro calls (see <a href="Macros.html#Macros">Macros</a>).

     <li><code>condition-case</code> (see <a href="Errors.html#Errors">Errors</a>). 
</ul>

   <p>Variables can also have buffer-local bindings (see <a href="Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html#Buffer_002dLocal-Variables">Buffer-Local Variables</a>); a few variables have terminal-local bindings
(see <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>).  These kinds of bindings work somewhat
like ordinary local bindings, but they are localized depending on
&ldquo;where&rdquo; you are in Emacs, rather than localized in time.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>max-specpdl-size</b><var><a name="index-max_002dspecpdl_002dsize-592"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-max_002dspecpdl_002dsize"></a><a name="index-variable-limit-error-593"></a><a name="index-evaluation-error-594"></a><a name="index-infinite-recursion-595"></a>This variable defines the limit on the total number of local variable
bindings and <code>unwind-protect</code> cleanups (see <a href="Cleanups.html#Cleanups">Cleaning Up from Nonlocal Exits</a>) that are allowed before Emacs
signals an error (with data <code>"Variable binding depth exceeds
max-specpdl-size"</code>).

        <p>This limit, with the associated error when it is exceeded, is one way
that Lisp avoids infinite recursion on an ill-defined function. 
<code>max-lisp-eval-depth</code> provides another limit on depth of nesting. 
See <a href="Definition-of-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth.html#Definition-of-max_002dlisp_002deval_002ddepth">Eval</a>.

        <p>The default value is 1000.  Entry to the Lisp debugger increases the
value, if there is little room left, to make sure the debugger itself
has room to execute.
