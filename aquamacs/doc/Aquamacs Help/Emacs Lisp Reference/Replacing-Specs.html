<h4 class="subsection">38.15.1 Display Specs That Replace The Text</h4>

<p>Some kinds of display specifications specify something to display
instead of the text that has the property.  These are called
<dfn>replacing</dfn> display specifications.  Emacs does not allow the user
to interactively move point into the middle of buffer text that is
replaced in this way.

   <p>If a list of display specifications includes more than one replacing
display specification, the first overrides the rest.  Replacing
display specifications make most other display specifications
irrelevant, since those don't apply to the replacement.

   <p>For replacing display specifications, &ldquo;the text that has the
property&rdquo; means all the consecutive characters that have the same
Lisp object as their <code>display</code> property; these characters are
replaced as a single unit.  If two characters have different Lisp
objects as their <code>display</code> properties (i.e., objects which are
not <code>eq</code>), they are handled separately.

   <p>Here is an example which illustrates this point.  A string serves as
a replacing display specification, which replaces the text that has
the property with the specified string (see <a href="Other-Display-Specs.html#Other-Display-Specs">Other Display Specs</a>). 
Consider the following function:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun foo ()
       (dotimes (i 5)
         (let ((string (concat "A"))
               (start (+ i i (point-min))))
           (put-text-property start (1+ start) 'display string)
           (put-text-property start (+ 2 start) 'display string))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This function gives each of the first ten characters in the buffer a
<code>display</code> property which is a string <code>"A"</code>, but they don't
all get the same string object.  The first two characters get the same
string object, so they are replaced with one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;; the fact that
the display property was assigned in two separate calls to
<code>put-text-property</code> is irrelevant.  Similarly, the next two
characters get a second string (<code>concat</code> creates a new string
object), so they are replaced with one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;; and so on.  Thus, the
ten characters appear as five A's.
