<h3 class="section">37.9 Receiving Output from Processes</h3>

<p><a name="index-process-output-3600"></a><a name="index-output-from-processes-3601"></a>
  There are two ways to receive the output that a subprocess writes to
its standard output stream.  The output can be inserted in a buffer,
which is called the associated buffer of the process (see <a href="Process-Buffers.html#Process-Buffers">Process Buffers</a>), or a function called the <dfn>filter function</dfn> can be
called to act on the output.  If the process has no buffer and no
filter function, its output is discarded.

   <p>When a subprocess terminates, Emacs reads any pending output,
then stops reading output from that subprocess.  Therefore, if the
subprocess has children that are still live and still producing
output, Emacs won't receive that output.

   <p>Output from a subprocess can arrive only while Emacs is waiting: when
reading terminal input (see the function <code>waiting-for-user-input-p</code>),
in <code>sit-for</code> and <code>sleep-for</code> (see <a href="Waiting.html#Waiting">Waiting</a>), and in
<code>accept-process-output</code> (see <a href="Accepting-Output.html#Accepting-Output">Accepting Output</a>).  This
minimizes the problem of timing errors that usually plague parallel
programming.  For example, you can safely create a process and only
then specify its buffer or filter function; no output can arrive
before you finish, if the code in between does not call any primitive
that waits.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>process-adaptive-read-buffering</b><var><a name="index-process_002dadaptive_002dread_002dbuffering-3602"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>On some systems, when Emacs reads the output from a subprocess, the
output data is read in very small blocks, potentially resulting in
very poor performance.  This behavior can be remedied to some extent
by setting the variable <code>process-adaptive-read-buffering</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value (the default), as it will automatically delay reading
from such processes, thus allowing them to produce more output before
Emacs tries to read it. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>It is impossible to separate the standard output and standard error
streams of the subprocess, because Emacs normally spawns the subprocess
inside a pseudo-TTY, and a pseudo-TTY has only one output channel.  If
you want to keep the output to those streams separate, you should
redirect one of them to a file&mdash;for example, by using an appropriate
shell command.
