<h3 class="section">39.19 Notifications on File Changes</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-notifications-4260"></a>
Several operating systems support watching of filesystems for changes
of files.  If configured properly, Emacs links a respective library
like <samp><span class="file">gfilenotify</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">inotify</span></samp>, or  <samp><span class="file">w32notify</span></samp>
statically.  These libraries enable watching of filesystems on the
local machine.

   <p>It is also possible to watch filesystems on remote machines,
see <a href="../emacs/Remote-Files.html#Remote-Files">Remote Files</a>
This does not depend on one of the libraries linked to Emacs.

   <p>Since all these libraries emit different events on notified file
changes, there is the Emacs library <code>filenotify</code> which provides a
unique interface.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-notify-add-watch</b><var> file flags callback<a name="index-file_002dnotify_002dadd_002dwatch-4261"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Add a watch for filesystem events pertaining to <var>file</var>.  This
arranges for filesystem events pertaining to <var>file</var> to be reported
to Emacs.

        <p>The returned value is a descriptor for the added watch.  Its type
depends on the underlying library, it cannot be assumed to be an
integer as in the example below.  It should be used for comparison by
<code>equal</code> only.

        <p>If the <var>file</var> cannot be watched for some reason, this function
signals a <code>file-notify-error</code> error.

        <p>Sometimes, mounted filesystems cannot be watched for file changes. 
This is not detected by this function, a non-<code>nil</code> return value
does not guarantee that changes on <var>file</var> will be notified.

        <p><var>flags</var> is a list of conditions to set what will be watched for. 
It can include the following symbols:

          <dl>
<dt><code>change</code><dd>watch for file changes
<br><dt><code>attribute-change</code><dd>watch for file attribute changes, like permissions or modification
time
</dl>

        <p>If <var>file</var> is a directory, changes for all files in that directory
will be notified.  This does not work recursively.

        <p>When any event happens, Emacs will call the <var>callback</var> function
passing it a single argument <var>event</var>, which is of the form

     <pre class="lisp">          (<var>descriptor</var> <var>action</var> <var>file</var> [<var>file1</var>])
</pre>
        <p><var>descriptor</var> is the same object as the one returned by this
function.  <var>action</var> is the description of the event.  It could be
any one of the following symbols:

          <dl>
<dt><code>created</code><dd><var>file</var> was created
<br><dt><code>deleted</code><dd><var>file</var> was deleted
<br><dt><code>changed</code><dd><var>file</var> has changed
<br><dt><code>renamed</code><dd><var>file</var> has been renamed to <var>file1</var>
<br><dt><code>attribute-changed</code><dd>a <var>file</var> attribute was changed
</dl>

        <p><var>file</var> and <var>file1</var> are the name of the file(s) whose event is
being reported.  For example:

     <pre class="example">          (require 'filenotify)
               &rArr; filenotify
          
          (defun my-notify-callback (event)
            (message "Event %S" event))
               &rArr; my-notify-callback
          
          (file-notify-add-watch
            "/tmp" '(change attribute-change) 'my-notify-callback)
               &rArr; 35025468
          
          (write-region "foo" nil "/tmp/foo")
               &rArr; Event (35025468 created "/tmp/.#foo")
                  Event (35025468 created "/tmp/foo")
                  Event (35025468 changed "/tmp/foo")
                  Event (35025468 deleted "/tmp/.#foo")
          
          (write-region "bla" nil "/tmp/foo")
               &rArr; Event (35025468 created "/tmp/.#foo")
                  Event (35025468 changed "/tmp/foo") [2 times]
                  Event (35025468 deleted "/tmp/.#foo")
          
          (set-file-modes "/tmp/foo" (default-file-modes))
               &rArr; Event (35025468 attribute-changed "/tmp/foo")
</pre>
        <p>Whether the action <code>renamed</code> is returned, depends on the used
watch library.  It can be expected, when a directory is watched, and
both <var>file</var> and <var>file1</var> belong to this directory.  Otherwise,
the actions <code>deleted</code> and <code>created</code> could be returned in a
random order.

     <pre class="example">          (rename-file "/tmp/foo" "/tmp/bla")
               &rArr; Event (35025468 renamed "/tmp/foo" "/tmp/bla")
          
          (file-notify-add-watch
            "/var/tmp" '(change attribute-change) 'my-notify-callback)
               &rArr; 35025504
          
          (rename-file "/tmp/bla" "/var/tmp/bla")
               &rArr; ;; gfilenotify
                  Event (35025468 renamed "/tmp/bla" "/var/tmp/bla")
          
               &rArr; ;; inotify
                  Event (35025504 created "/var/tmp/bla")
                  Event (35025468 deleted "/tmp/bla")
</pre>
