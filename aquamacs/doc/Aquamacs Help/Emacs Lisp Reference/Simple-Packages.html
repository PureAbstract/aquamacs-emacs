<h3 class="section">40.2 Simple Packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-single-file-packages-3913"></a>
  The simplest package consists of a single Emacs Lisp source file. 
In this case, all the attributes of the package (see <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>) are taken from this file.

   <p>The package system expects this <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file to conform to the
Emacs Lisp library header conventions.  See <a href="Library-Headers.html#Library-Headers">Library Headers</a>.

   <p>The name of the package is the same as the base name of the
<samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file, as written in the first comment line.  For example,
given the header line:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;; superfrobnicator.el --- frobnicate and bifurcate flanges
</pre>
   <p>the package name will be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">superfrobnicator</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The short description of the package is also taken from the first
line of the file.

   <p>If the file has a &ldquo;Commentary&rdquo; header, then it is used as the long
description.

   <p>The version of the package comes either from the &ldquo;Package-Version&rdquo;
header, if it exists, or from the &ldquo;Version&rdquo; header.  A package is
required to have a version number.  Each release of a package must be
accompanied by an increase in the version number.

   <p>If the file has a &ldquo;Package-Requires&rdquo; header, then that is used as
the package dependencies.  Otherwise, the package is assumed not to
have any dependencies.

   <p>A single-file package cannot have an Info manual.

   <p>The file will be scanned for autoload cookies at install time. 
See <a href="Autoload.html#Autoload">Autoload</a>.
