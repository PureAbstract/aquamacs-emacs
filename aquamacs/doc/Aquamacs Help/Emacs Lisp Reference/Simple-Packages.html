<h3 class="section">40.2 Simple Packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-single-file-package-4275"></a><a name="index-simple-package-4276"></a>
  A simple package consists of a single Emacs Lisp source file.  The
file must conform to the Emacs Lisp library header conventions
(see <a href="Library-Headers.html#Library-Headers">Library Headers</a>).  The package's attributes are taken from
the various headers, as illustrated by the following example:

<pre class="example">     ;;; superfrobnicator.el --- Frobnicate and bifurcate flanges
     
     ;; Copyright (C) 2011 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     
     ;; Author: J. R. Hacker &lt;jrh@example.com&gt;
     ;; Version: 1.3
     ;; Package-Requires: ((flange "1.0"))
     ;; Keywords: frobnicate
     
     ...
     
     ;;; Commentary:
     
     ;; This package provides a minor mode to frobnicate and/or
     ;; bifurcate any flanges you desire.  To activate it, just type
     ...
     
     ;;;###autoload
     (define-minor-mode superfrobnicator-mode
     ...
</pre>
   <p>The name of the package is the same as the base name of the file, as
written on the first line.  Here, it is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">superfrobnicator</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The brief description is also taken from the first line.  Here, it
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Frobnicate and bifurcate flanges</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The version number comes from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Package-Version</span></samp>&rsquo; header, if
it exists, or from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Version</span></samp>&rsquo; header otherwise.  One or the
other <em>must</em> be present.  Here, the version number is 1.3.

   <p>If the file has a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; Commentary:</span></samp>&rsquo; section, this section is
used as the long description.  (When displaying the description, Emacs
omits the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;; Commentary:</span></samp>&rsquo; line, as well as the leading comment
characters in the commentary itself.)

   <p>If the file has a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Package-Requires</span></samp>&rsquo; header, that is used as
the package dependencies.  In the above example, the package depends
on the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flange</span></samp>&rsquo; package, version 1.0 or higher.  See <a href="Library-Headers.html#Library-Headers">Library Headers</a>, for a description of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Package-Requires</span></samp>&rsquo; header.  If
the header is omitted, the package has no dependencies.

   <p>The file ought to also contain one or more autoload magic comments,
as explained in <a href="Packaging-Basics.html#Packaging-Basics">Packaging Basics</a>.  In the above example, a magic
comment autoloads <code>superfrobnicator-mode</code>.

   <p>See <a href="Package-Archives.html#Package-Archives">Package Archives</a>, for a explanation of how to add a
single-file package to a package archive.
