<h3 class="section">14.2 Defining Customization Groups</h3>

<p><a name="index-define-customization-group-760"></a><a name="index-customization-groups_002c-defining-761"></a>
  Each Emacs Lisp package should have one main customization group which
contains all the options, faces and other groups in the package.  If the
package has a small number of options and faces, use just one group and
put everything in it.  When there are more than twelve or so options and
faces, then you should structure them into subgroups, and put the
subgroups under the package's main customization group.  It is OK to
put some of the options and faces in the package's main group alongside
the subgroups.

   <p>The package's main or only group should be a member of one or more of
the standard customization groups.  (To display the full list of them,
use <kbd>M-x customize</kbd>.)  Choose one or more of them (but not too
many), and add your group to each of them using the <code>:group</code>
keyword.

   <p>The way to declare new customization groups is with <code>defgroup</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>defgroup</b><var> group members doc </var>[<var>keyword value</var>]<var><small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-defgroup-762"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Declare <var>group</var> as a customization group containing <var>members</var>. 
Do not quote the symbol <var>group</var>.  The argument <var>doc</var> specifies
the documentation string for the group.

        <p>The argument <var>members</var> is a list specifying an initial set of
customization items to be members of the group.  However, most often
<var>members</var> is <code>nil</code>, and you specify the group's members by
using the <code>:group</code> keyword when defining those members.

        <p>If you want to specify group members through <var>members</var>, each element
should have the form <code>(</code><var>name</var> <var>widget</var><code>)</code>.  Here <var>name</var>
is a symbol, and <var>widget</var> is a widget type for editing that symbol. 
Useful widgets are <code>custom-variable</code> for a variable,
<code>custom-face</code> for a face, and <code>custom-group</code> for a group.

        <p>When you introduce a new group into Emacs, use the <code>:version</code>
keyword in the <code>defgroup</code>; then you need not use it for
the individual members of the group.

        <p>In addition to the common keywords (see <a href="Common-Keywords.html#Common-Keywords">Common Keywords</a>), you can
also use this keyword in <code>defgroup</code>:

          <dl>
<dt><code>:prefix </code><var>prefix</var><dd><a name="index-prefix_0040r_007b_002c-_0040code_007bdefgroup_007d-keyword_007d-763"></a>If the name of an item in the group starts with <var>prefix</var>, then the
tag for that item is constructed (by default) by omitting <var>prefix</var>.

          <p>One group can have any number of prefixes. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The prefix-discarding feature is currently turned off, which means
that <code>:prefix</code> currently has no effect.  We did this because we
found that discarding the specified prefixes often led to confusing
names for options.  This happened because the people who wrote the
<code>defgroup</code> definitions for various groups added <code>:prefix</code>
keywords whenever they make logical sense&mdash;that is, whenever the
variables in the library have a common prefix.

   <p>In order to obtain good results with <code>:prefix</code>, it would be
necessary to check the specific effects of discarding a particular
prefix, given the specific items in a group and their names and
documentation.  If the resulting text is not clear, then <code>:prefix</code>
should not be used in that case.

   <p>It should be possible to recheck all the customization groups, delete
the <code>:prefix</code> specifications which give unclear results, and then
turn this feature back on, if someone would like to do the work.
