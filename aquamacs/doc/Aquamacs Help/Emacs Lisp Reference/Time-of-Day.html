<h3 class="section">39.5 Time of Day</h3>

<p>This section explains how to determine the current time and the time
zone.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-time-string</b><var> &amp;optional time-value<a name="index-current_002dtime_002dstring-3761"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current time and date as a human-readable
string.  The format of the string is unvarying; the number of characters
used for each part is always the same, so you can reliably use
<code>substring</code> to extract pieces of it.  It is wise to count the
characters from the beginning of the string rather than from the end, as
additional information may some day be added at the end.

        <p>The argument <var>time-value</var>, if given, specifies a time to format
instead of the current time.  This argument should have the same form
as the times obtained from <code>current-time</code> (see below) and from
<code>file-attributes</code> (see <a href="Definition-of-file_002dattributes.html#Definition-of-file_002dattributes">Definition of file-attributes</a>).  It
should be a list whose first two elements are integers; a third
(microsecond) element, if present, is ignored.  <var>time-value</var> can
also be a cons of two integers, but this usage is obsolete.

     <pre class="example">          (current-time-string)
               &rArr; "Wed Oct 14 22:21:05 1987"
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-time</b><var><a name="index-current_002dtime-3762"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the system's time value as a list of three
integers: <code>(</code><var>high</var> <var>low</var> <var>microsec</var><code>)</code>.  The integers
<var>high</var> and <var>low</var> combine to give the number of seconds since
0:00 January 1, 1970 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), which is
<var>high</var> * 2**16 + <var>low</var>.

        <p>The third element, <var>microsec</var>, gives the microseconds since the
start of the current second (or 0 for systems that return time with
the resolution of only one second).

        <p>The first two elements can be compared with file time values such as you
get with the function <code>file-attributes</code>. 
See <a href="Definition-of-file_002dattributes.html#Definition-of-file_002dattributes">Definition of file-attributes</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-time-zone</b><var> &amp;optional time-value<a name="index-current_002dtime_002dzone-3763"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a list describing the time zone that the user is
in.

        <p>The value has the form <code>(</code><var>offset</var> <var>name</var><code>)</code>.  Here
<var>offset</var> is an integer giving the number of seconds ahead of UTC
(east of Greenwich).  A negative value means west of Greenwich.  The
second element, <var>name</var>, is a string giving the name of the time
zone.  Both elements change when daylight saving time begins or ends;
if the user has specified a time zone that does not use a seasonal time
adjustment, then the value is constant through time.

        <p>If the operating system doesn't supply all the information necessary to
compute the value, the unknown elements of the list are <code>nil</code>.

        <p>The argument <var>time-value</var>, if given, specifies a time to analyze
instead of the current time.  The argument should have the same form
as for <code>current-time-string</code> (see above).  Thus, you can use
times obtained from <code>current-time</code> (see above) and from
<code>file-attributes</code>.  See <a href="Definition-of-file_002dattributes.html#Definition-of-file_002dattributes">Definition of file-attributes</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-time-zone-rule</b><var> tz<a name="index-set_002dtime_002dzone_002drule-3764"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function specifies the local time zone according to <var>tz</var>.  If
<var>tz</var> is <code>nil</code>, that means to use an implementation-defined
default time zone.  If <var>tz</var> is <code>t</code>, that means to use
Universal Time.  Otherwise, <var>tz</var> should be a string specifying a
time zone rule. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>float-time</b><var> &amp;optional time-value<a name="index-float_002dtime-3765"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current time as a floating-point number of
seconds since the epoch.  The argument <var>time-value</var>, if given,
specifies a time to convert instead of the current time.  The argument
should have the same form as for <code>current-time-string</code> (see
above).  Thus, it accepts the output of <code>current-time</code> and
<code>file-attributes</code> (see <a href="Definition-of-file_002dattributes.html#Definition-of-file_002dattributes">Definition of file-attributes</a>).

        <p><em>Warning</em>: Since the result is floating point, it may not be
exact.  Do not use this function if precise time stamps are required.
