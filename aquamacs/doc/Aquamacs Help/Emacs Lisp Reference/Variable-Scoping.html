<h3 class="section">11.9 Scoping Rules for Variable Bindings</h3>

<p>When you create a local binding for a variable, that binding takes
effect only within a limited portion of the program (see <a href="Local-Variables.html#Local-Variables">Local Variables</a>).  This section describes exactly what this means.

   <p><a name="index-scope-638"></a><a name="index-extent-639"></a>  Each local binding has a certain <dfn>scope</dfn> and <dfn>extent</dfn>. 
<dfn>Scope</dfn> refers to <em>where</em> in the textual source code the
binding can be accessed.  <dfn>Extent</dfn> refers to <em>when</em>, as the
program is executing, the binding exists.

   <p><a name="index-dynamic-binding-640"></a><a name="index-indefinite-scope-641"></a><a name="index-dynamic-extent-642"></a>  By default, the local bindings that Emacs creates are <dfn>dynamic
bindings</dfn>.  Such a binding has <dfn>indefinite scope</dfn>, meaning that
any part of the program can potentially access the variable binding. 
It also has <dfn>dynamic extent</dfn>, meaning that the binding lasts only
while the binding construct (such as the body of a <code>let</code> form) is
being executed.

   <p><a name="index-lexical-binding-643"></a><a name="index-lexical-scope-644"></a><a name="index-indefinite-extent-645"></a>  Emacs can optionally create <dfn>lexical bindings</dfn>.  A lexical
binding has <dfn>lexical scope</dfn>, meaning that any reference to the
variable must be located textually within the binding construct.  It
also has <dfn>indefinite extent</dfn>, meaning that under some
circumstances the binding can live on even after the binding construct
has finished executing, by means of special objects called
<dfn>closures</dfn>.

   <p>The following subsections describe dynamic binding and lexical
binding in greater detail, and how to enable lexical binding in Emacs
Lisp programs.
