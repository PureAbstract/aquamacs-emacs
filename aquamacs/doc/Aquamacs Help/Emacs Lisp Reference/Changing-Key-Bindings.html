<h3 class="section">22.12 Changing Key Bindings</h3>

<p><a name="index-changing-key-bindings-1522"></a><a name="index-rebinding-1523"></a>
  The way to rebind a key is to change its entry in a keymap.  If you
change a binding in the global keymap, the change is effective in all
buffers (though it has no direct effect in buffers that shadow the
global binding with a local one).  If you change the current buffer's
local map, that usually affects all buffers using the same major mode. 
The <code>global-set-key</code> and <code>local-set-key</code> functions are
convenient interfaces for these operations (see <a href="Key-Binding-Commands.html#Key-Binding-Commands">Key Binding Commands</a>).  You can also use <code>define-key</code>, a more general
function; then you must specify explicitly the map to change.

   <p>When choosing the key sequences for Lisp programs to rebind, please
follow the Emacs conventions for use of various keys (see <a href="Key-Binding-Conventions.html#Key-Binding-Conventions">Key Binding Conventions</a>).

   <p><a name="index-meta-character-key-constants-1524"></a><a name="index-control-character-key-constants-1525"></a>  In writing the key sequence to rebind, it is good to use the special
escape sequences for control and meta characters (see <a href="String-Type.html#String-Type">String Type</a>). 
The syntax &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\C-</span></samp>&rsquo; means that the following character is a control
character and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\M-</span></samp>&rsquo; means that the following character is a meta
character.  Thus, the string <code>"\M-x"</code> is read as containing a
single <kbd>M-x</kbd>, <code>"\C-f"</code> is read as containing a single
<kbd>C-f</kbd>, and <code>"\M-\C-x"</code> and <code>"\C-\M-x"</code> are both read as
containing a single <kbd>C-M-x</kbd>.  You can also use this escape syntax in
vectors, as well as others that aren't allowed in strings; one example
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[?\C-\H-x home]</span></samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="Character-Type.html#Character-Type">Character Type</a>.

   <p>The key definition and lookup functions accept an alternate syntax for
event types in a key sequence that is a vector: you can use a list
containing modifier names plus one base event (a character or function
key name).  For example, <code>(control ?a)</code> is equivalent to
<code>?\C-a</code> and <code>(hyper control left)</code> is equivalent to
<code>C-H-left</code>.  One advantage of such lists is that the precise
numeric codes for the modifier bits don't appear in compiled files.

   <p>The functions below signal an error if <var>keymap</var> is not a keymap,
or if <var>key</var> is not a string or vector representing a key sequence. 
You can use event types (symbols) as shorthand for events that are
lists.  The <code>kbd</code> macro (see <a href="Key-Sequences.html#Key-Sequences">Key Sequences</a>) is a convenient
way to specify the key sequence.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>define-key</b><var> keymap key binding<a name="index-define_002dkey-1526"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets the binding for <var>key</var> in <var>keymap</var>.  (If
<var>key</var> is more than one event long, the change is actually made
in another keymap reached from <var>keymap</var>.)  The argument
<var>binding</var> can be any Lisp object, but only certain types are
meaningful.  (For a list of meaningful types, see <a href="Key-Lookup.html#Key-Lookup">Key Lookup</a>.) 
The value returned by <code>define-key</code> is <var>binding</var>.

        <p>If <var>key</var> is <code>[t]</code>, this sets the default binding in
<var>keymap</var>.  When an event has no binding of its own, the Emacs
command loop uses the keymap's default binding, if there is one.

        <p><a name="index-invalid-prefix-key-error-1527"></a><a name="index-key-sequence-error-1528"></a>Every prefix of <var>key</var> must be a prefix key (i.e., bound to a keymap)
or undefined; otherwise an error is signaled.  If some prefix of
<var>key</var> is undefined, then <code>define-key</code> defines it as a prefix
key so that the rest of <var>key</var> can be defined as specified.

        <p>If there was previously no binding for <var>key</var> in <var>keymap</var>, the
new binding is added at the beginning of <var>keymap</var>.  The order of
bindings in a keymap makes no difference for keyboard input, but it
does matter for menu keymaps (see <a href="Menu-Keymaps.html#Menu-Keymaps">Menu Keymaps</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>This example creates a sparse keymap and makes a number of
bindings in it:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq map (make-sparse-keymap))
         &rArr; (keymap)
     (define-key map "\C-f" 'forward-char)
         &rArr; forward-char
     map
         &rArr; (keymap (6 . forward-char))
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Build sparse submap for </span><kbd>C-x</kbd><span class="roman"> and bind </span><kbd>f</kbd><span class="roman"> in that.</span>
     (define-key map (kbd "C-x f") 'forward-word)
         &rArr; forward-word
     map
     &rArr; (keymap
         (24 keymap                ; <kbd>C-x</kbd>
             (102 . forward-word)) ;      <kbd>f</kbd>
         (6 . forward-char))       ; <kbd>C-f</kbd>
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Bind </span><kbd>C-p</kbd><span class="roman"> to the </span><code>ctl-x-map</code><span class="roman">.</span>
     (define-key map (kbd "C-p") ctl-x-map)
     ;; <code>ctl-x-map</code>
     &rArr; [nil ... find-file ... backward-kill-sentence]
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Bind </span><kbd>C-f</kbd><span class="roman"> to </span><code>foo</code><span class="roman"> in the </span><code>ctl-x-map</code><span class="roman">.</span>
     (define-key map (kbd "C-p C-f") 'foo)
     &rArr; 'foo
     map
     &rArr; (keymap     ; <span class="roman">Note </span><code>foo</code><span class="roman"> in </span><code>ctl-x-map</code><span class="roman">.</span>
         (16 keymap [nil ... foo ... backward-kill-sentence])
         (24 keymap
             (102 . forward-word))
         (6 . forward-char))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that storing a new binding for <kbd>C-p C-f</kbd> actually works by
changing an entry in <code>ctl-x-map</code>, and this has the effect of
changing the bindings of both <kbd>C-p C-f</kbd> and <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> in the
default global map.

   <p>The function <code>substitute-key-definition</code> scans a keymap for
keys that have a certain binding and rebinds them with a different
binding.  Another feature which is cleaner and can often produce the
same results to remap one command into another (see <a href="Remapping-Commands.html#Remapping-Commands">Remapping Commands</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>substitute-key-definition</b><var> olddef newdef keymap &amp;optional oldmap<a name="index-substitute_002dkey_002ddefinition-1529"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-replace-bindings-1530"></a>This function replaces <var>olddef</var> with <var>newdef</var> for any keys in
<var>keymap</var> that were bound to <var>olddef</var>.  In other words,
<var>olddef</var> is replaced with <var>newdef</var> wherever it appears.  The
function returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>For example, this redefines <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd>, if you do it in an Emacs with
standard bindings:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (substitute-key-definition
           'find-file 'find-file-read-only (current-global-map))
</pre>
        <!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
        <p>If <var>oldmap</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that changes the behavior of
<code>substitute-key-definition</code>: the bindings in <var>oldmap</var> determine
which keys to rebind.  The rebindings still happen in <var>keymap</var>, not
in <var>oldmap</var>.  Thus, you can change one map under the control of the
bindings in another.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          (substitute-key-definition
            'delete-backward-char 'my-funny-delete
            my-map global-map)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">puts the special deletion command in <code>my-map</code> for whichever keys
are globally bound to the standard deletion command.

        <p>Here is an example showing a keymap before and after substitution:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (setq map '(keymap
                      (?1 . olddef-1)
                      (?2 . olddef-2)
                      (?3 . olddef-1)))
          &rArr; (keymap (49 . olddef-1) (50 . olddef-2) (51 . olddef-1))
          
          (substitute-key-definition 'olddef-1 'newdef map)
          &rArr; nil
          map
          &rArr; (keymap (49 . newdef) (50 . olddef-2) (51 . newdef))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>suppress-keymap</b><var> keymap &amp;optional nodigits<a name="index-suppress_002dkeymap-1531"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bself_002dinsert_002dcommand_007d-override-1532"></a>This function changes the contents of the full keymap <var>keymap</var> by
remapping <code>self-insert-command</code> to the command <code>undefined</code>
(see <a href="Remapping-Commands.html#Remapping-Commands">Remapping Commands</a>).  This has the effect of undefining all
printing characters, thus making ordinary insertion of text impossible. 
<code>suppress-keymap</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>If <var>nodigits</var> is <code>nil</code>, then <code>suppress-keymap</code> defines
digits to run <code>digit-argument</code>, and <kbd>-</kbd> to run
<code>negative-argument</code>.  Otherwise it makes them undefined like the
rest of the printing characters.

        <p><a name="index-yank-suppression-1533"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bquoted_002dinsert_007d-suppression-1534"></a>The <code>suppress-keymap</code> function does not make it impossible to
modify a buffer, as it does not suppress commands such as <code>yank</code>
and <code>quoted-insert</code>.  To prevent any modification of a buffer, make
it read-only (see <a href="Read-Only-Buffers.html#Read-Only-Buffers">Read Only Buffers</a>).

        <p>Since this function modifies <var>keymap</var>, you would normally use it
on a newly created keymap.  Operating on an existing keymap
that is used for some other purpose is likely to cause trouble; for
example, suppressing <code>global-map</code> would make it impossible to use
most of Emacs.

        <p>Most often, <code>suppress-keymap</code> is used to initialize local
keymaps of modes such as Rmail and Dired where insertion of text is not
desirable and the buffer is read-only.  Here is an example taken from
the file <samp><span class="file">emacs/lisp/dired.el</span></samp>, showing how the local keymap for
Dired mode is set up:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (setq dired-mode-map (make-keymap))
          (suppress-keymap dired-mode-map)
          (define-key dired-mode-map "r" 'dired-rename-file)
          (define-key dired-mode-map "\C-d" 'dired-flag-file-deleted)
          (define-key dired-mode-map "d" 'dired-flag-file-deleted)
          (define-key dired-mode-map "v" 'dired-view-file)
          (define-key dired-mode-map "e" 'dired-find-file)
          (define-key dired-mode-map "f" 'dired-find-file)
          ...
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
