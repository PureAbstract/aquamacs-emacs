<h3 class="section">17.5 Activation of Advice</h3>

<p><a name="index-activating-advice-948"></a><a name="index-advice_002c-activating-949"></a>
By default, advice does not take effect when you define it&mdash;only when
you <dfn>activate</dfn> advice for the function.  However, the advice will
be activated automatically if you define or redefine the function
later.  You can request the activation of advice for a function when
you define the advice, by specifying the <code>activate</code> flag in the
<code>defadvice</code>; or you can activate the advice separately by calling
the function <code>ad-activate</code> or one of the other activation
commands listed below.

   <p>Separating the activation of advice from the act of defining it permits
you to add several pieces of advice to one function efficiently, without
redefining the function over and over as each advice is added.  More
importantly, it permits defining advice for a function before that
function is actually defined.

   <p>When a function's advice is first activated, the function's original
definition is saved, and all enabled pieces of advice for that function
are combined with the original definition to make a new definition. 
(Pieces of advice that are currently disabled are not used; see
<a href="Enabling-Advice.html#Enabling-Advice">Enabling Advice</a>.)  This definition is installed, and optionally
byte-compiled as well, depending on conditions described below.

   <p>In all of the commands to activate advice, if <var>compile</var> is
<code>t</code> (or anything but <code>nil</code> or a negative number), the
command also compiles the combined definition which implements the
advice.  If it is <code>nil</code> or a negative number, what happens
depends on <code>ad-default-compilation-action</code> as described below.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-activate</b><var> function &amp;optional compile<a name="index-ad_002dactivate-950"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command activates all the advice defined for <var>function</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Activating advice does nothing if <var>function</var>'s advice is already
active.  But if there is new advice, added since the previous time you
activated advice for <var>function</var>, it activates the new advice.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-deactivate</b><var> function<a name="index-ad_002ddeactivate-951"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command deactivates the advice for <var>function</var>. 
<a name="index-deactivating-advice-952"></a><!-- @cindex advice, deactivating   "advice, activating" is just above -->
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-update</b><var> function &amp;optional compile<a name="index-ad_002dupdate-953"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command activates the advice for <var>function</var>
if its advice is already activated.  This is useful
if you change the advice. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-activate-all</b><var> &amp;optional compile<a name="index-ad_002dactivate_002dall-954"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command activates the advice for all functions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-deactivate-all</b><var><a name="index-ad_002ddeactivate_002dall-955"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command deactivates the advice for all functions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-update-all</b><var> &amp;optional compile<a name="index-ad_002dupdate_002dall-956"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command activates the advice for all functions
whose advice is already activated.  This is useful
if you change the advice of some functions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-activate-regexp</b><var> regexp &amp;optional compile<a name="index-ad_002dactivate_002dregexp-957"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command activates all pieces of advice whose names match
<var>regexp</var>.  More precisely, it activates all advice for any function
which has at least one piece of advice that matches <var>regexp</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-deactivate-regexp</b><var> regexp<a name="index-ad_002ddeactivate_002dregexp-958"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command deactivates all pieces of advice whose names match
<var>regexp</var>.  More precisely, it deactivates all advice for any
function which has at least one piece of advice that matches
<var>regexp</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-update-regexp</b><var> regexp &amp;optional compile<a name="index-ad_002dupdate_002dregexp-959"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command activates pieces of advice whose names match <var>regexp</var>,
but only those for functions whose advice is already activated. 
<a name="index-reactivating-advice-960"></a>
Reactivating a function's advice is useful for putting into effect all
the changes that have been made in its advice (including enabling and
disabling specific pieces of advice; see <a href="Enabling-Advice.html#Enabling-Advice">Enabling Advice</a>) since the
last time it was activated. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-start-advice</b><var><a name="index-ad_002dstart_002dadvice-961"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Turn on automatic advice activation when a function is defined or
redefined.  This is the default mode. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>ad-stop-advice</b><var><a name="index-ad_002dstop_002dadvice-962"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Turn off automatic advice activation when a function is defined or
redefined. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>ad-default-compilation-action</b><var><a name="index-ad_002ddefault_002dcompilation_002daction-963"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable controls whether to compile the combined definition
that results from activating advice for a function.

        <p>A value of <code>always</code> specifies to compile unconditionally. 
A value of <code>never</code> specifies never compile the advice.

        <p>A value of <code>maybe</code> specifies to compile if the byte compiler is
already loaded.  A value of <code>like-original</code> specifies to compile
the advice if the original definition of the advised function is
compiled or a built-in function.

        <p>This variable takes effect only if the <var>compile</var> argument of
<code>ad-activate</code> (or any of the above functions) did not force
compilation. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If the advised definition was constructed during &ldquo;preactivation&rdquo;
(see <a href="Preactivation.html#Preactivation">Preactivation</a>), then that definition must already be compiled,
because it was constructed during byte-compilation of the file that
contained the <code>defadvice</code> with the <code>preactivate</code> flag.
