<h3 class="section">40.3 Multi-file Packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-multi_002dfile-packages-3914"></a>
  A multi-file package is just a <samp><span class="file">.tar</span></samp> file.  While less
convenient to create than a single-file package, a multi-file package
also offers more features: it can include an Info manual, multiple
Emacs Lisp files, and also other data files needed by a package.

   <p>The contents of the <samp><span class="file">.tar</span></samp> file must all appear beneath a
single directory, named after the package and version.  Files can
appear in subdirectories of this top-most directory, but Emacs Lisp
code will only be found (and thus byte-compiled) at the top-most
level.  Also, the <samp><span class="file">.tar</span></samp> file is typically also given this same
name.  For example, if you are distributing version 1.3 of the
superfrobnicator, the package file would be named
&ldquo;superfrobnicator-1.3.tar&rdquo; and the contents would all appear in the
directory <samp><span class="file">superfrobnicator-1.3</span></samp> in that <samp><span class="file">.tar</span></samp>.

   <p>The package must include a <samp><span class="file">-pkg.el</span></samp> file, named after the
package.  In our example above, this file would be called
<samp><span class="file">superfrobnicator-pkg.el</span></samp>.  This file must have a single form in
it, a call to <code>define-package</code>.  The package dependencies and
brief description are taken from this form.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>define-package</b><var> name version &amp;optional docstring requirements<a name="index-define_002dpackage-3915"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Define a package.  <var>name</var> is the name of the package, a string. 
<var>version</var> is the package's version, a string.  It must be in a
form that can be understood by <code>version-to-list</code>. 
<var>docstring</var> is the short description of the package. 
<var>requirements</var> is a list of required packages and their versions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If a <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file exists in the content directory, then it is
used as the long description.

   <p>If the package has an Info manual, you should distribute the needed
info files, plus a <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> file made with <samp><span class="command">install-info</span></samp>. 
See <a href="../texinfo/Invoking-install_002dinfo.html#Invoking-install_002dinfo">Invoking install-info</a>.

   <p>Do not include any <samp><span class="file">.elc</span></samp> files in the package.  Those will be
created at install time.  Note that there is no way to control the
order in which files are byte-compiled; your package must be robust
here.

   <p>The installation process will scan all the <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> files in the
package for autoload cookies.  See <a href="Autoload.html#Autoload">Autoload</a>.  They are extracted
into a <samp><span class="file">-autoloads.el</span></samp> file (e.g.,
<samp><span class="file">superfrobnicator-autoloads.el</span></samp>), so do not include a file of
that name in your package.

   <p>Any other files in the <samp><span class="file">.tar</span></samp> file are simply unpacked when the
package is installed.  This can be useful if your package needs
auxiliary data files &mdash; e.g., icons or sounds.

   <p>Emacs Lisp code installed via the package manager must take special
care to be location-independent.  One easy way to do this is to make
references to auxiliary data files relative to <var>load-file-name</var>. 
For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defconst superfrobnicator-base (file-name-directory load-file-name))
     
     (defun superfrobnicator-fetch-image (file)
       (expand-file-name file superfrobnicator-base))
</pre>
