<h4 class="subsection">23.2.5 Basic Major Modes</h4>

<p>Apart from Fundamental mode, there are three major modes that other
major modes commonly derive from: Text mode, Prog mode, and Special
mode.  While Text mode is useful in its own right (e.g., for editing
files ending in <samp><span class="file">.txt</span></samp>), Prog mode and Special mode exist mainly to
let other modes derive from them.

   <p><a name="index-prog_002dmode_002dhook-1719"></a>  As far as possible, new major modes should be derived, either directly
or indirectly, from one of these three modes.  One reason is that this
allows users to customize a single mode hook
(e.g., <code>prog-mode-hook</code>) for an entire family of relevant modes
(e.g., all programming language modes).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>text-mode</b><var><a name="index-text_002dmode-1720"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Text mode is a major mode for editing human languages.  It defines the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; characters as having punctuation syntax
(see <a href="Syntax-Class-Table.html#Syntax-Class-Table">Syntax Class Table</a>), and binds <kbd>M-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> to
<code>ispell-complete-word</code> (see <a href="../emacs/Spelling.html#Spelling">Spelling</a>).

        <p>An example of a major mode derived from Text mode is HTML mode. 
See <a href="../emacs/HTML-Mode.html#HTML-Mode">SGML and HTML Modes</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>prog-mode</b><var><a name="index-prog_002dmode-1721"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Prog mode is a basic major mode for buffers containing programming
language source code.  Most of the programming language major modes
built into Emacs are derived from it.

        <p>Prog mode binds <code>parse-sexp-ignore-comments</code> to <code>t</code>
(see <a href="Motion-via-Parsing.html#Motion-via-Parsing">Motion via Parsing</a>) and <code>bidi-paragraph-direction</code> to
<code>left-to-right</code> (see <a href="Bidirectional-Display.html#Bidirectional-Display">Bidirectional Display</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>special-mode</b><var><a name="index-special_002dmode-1722"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Special mode is a basic major mode for buffers containing text that is
produced specially by Emacs, rather than directly from a file.  Major
modes derived from Special mode are given a <code>mode-class</code> property
of <code>special</code> (see <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode Conventions</a>).

        <p>Special mode sets the buffer to read-only.  Its keymap defines several
common bindings, including <kbd>q</kbd> for <code>quit-window</code> and <kbd>g</kbd>
for <code>revert-buffer</code> (see <a href="Reverting.html#Reverting">Reverting</a>).

        <p>An example of a major mode derived from Special mode is Buffer Menu
mode, which is used by the <samp><span class="file">*Buffer List*</span></samp> buffer.  See <a href="../emacs/List-Buffers.html#List-Buffers">Listing Existing Buffers</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>In addition, modes for buffers of tabulated data can inherit from
Tabulated List mode, which is in turn derived from Special mode. 
See <a href="Tabulated-List-Mode.html#Tabulated-List-Mode">Tabulated List Mode</a>.
