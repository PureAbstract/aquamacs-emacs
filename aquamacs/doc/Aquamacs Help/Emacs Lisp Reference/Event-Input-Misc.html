<h4 class="subsection">21.8.6 Miscellaneous Event Input Features</h4>

<p>This section describes how to &ldquo;peek ahead&rdquo; at events without using
them up, how to check for pending input, and how to discard pending
input.  See also the function <code>read-passwd</code> (see <a href="Reading-a-Password.html#Reading-a-Password">Reading a Password</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>unread-command-events</b><var><a name="index-unread_002dcommand_002devents-1454"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-next-input-1455"></a><a name="index-peeking-at-input-1456"></a>This variable holds a list of events waiting to be read as command
input.  The events are used in the order they appear in the list, and
removed one by one as they are used.

        <p>The variable is needed because in some cases a function reads an event
and then decides not to use it.  Storing the event in this variable
causes it to be processed normally, by the command loop or by the
functions to read command input.

        <p><a name="index-prefix-argument-unreading-1457"></a>For example, the function that implements numeric prefix arguments reads
any number of digits.  When it finds a non-digit event, it must unread
the event so that it can be read normally by the command loop. 
Likewise, incremental search uses this feature to unread events with no
special meaning in a search, because these events should exit the search
and then execute normally.

        <p>The reliable and easy way to extract events from a key sequence so as
to put them in <code>unread-command-events</code> is to use
<code>listify-key-sequence</code> (see below).

        <p>Normally you add events to the front of this list, so that the events
most recently unread will be reread first.

        <p>Events read from this list are not normally added to the current
command's key sequence (as returned by, e.g., <code>this-command-keys</code>),
as the events will already have been added once as they were read for
the first time.  An element of the form <code>(t . </code><var>event</var><code>)</code>
forces <var>event</var> to be added to the current command's key sequence. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>listify-key-sequence</b><var> key<a name="index-listify_002dkey_002dsequence-1458"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function converts the string or vector <var>key</var> to a list of
individual events, which you can put in <code>unread-command-events</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>input-pending-p</b><var><a name="index-input_002dpending_002dp-1459"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-waiting-for-command-key-input-1460"></a>This function determines whether any command input is currently
available to be read.  It returns immediately, with value <code>t</code> if
there is available input, <code>nil</code> otherwise.  On rare occasions it
may return <code>t</code> when no input is available. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>last-input-event</b><var><a name="index-last_002dinput_002devent-1461"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable records the last terminal input event read, whether
as part of a command or explicitly by a Lisp program.

        <p>In the example below, the Lisp program reads the character <kbd>1</kbd>,
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> code 49.  It becomes the value of <code>last-input-event</code>,
while <kbd>C-e</kbd> (we assume <kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> command is used to evaluate
this expression) remains the value of <code>last-command-event</code>.

     <pre class="example">          (progn (print (read-char))
                 (print last-command-event)
                 last-input-event)
               -| 49
               -| 5
               &rArr; 49
</pre>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>while-no-input</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-while_002dno_002dinput-1462"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This construct runs the <var>body</var> forms and returns the value of the
last one&mdash;but only if no input arrives.  If any input arrives during
the execution of the <var>body</var> forms, it aborts them (working much
like a quit).  The <code>while-no-input</code> form returns <code>nil</code> if
aborted by a real quit, and returns <code>t</code> if aborted by arrival of
other input.

        <p>If a part of <var>body</var> binds <code>inhibit-quit</code> to non-<code>nil</code>,
arrival of input during those parts won't cause an abort until
the end of that part.

        <p>If you want to be able to distinguish all possible values computed
by <var>body</var> from both kinds of abort conditions, write the code
like this:

     <pre class="example">          (while-no-input
            (list
              (progn . <var>body</var>)))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>discard-input</b><var><a name="index-discard_002dinput-1463"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-flushing-input-1464"></a><a name="index-discarding-input-1465"></a><a name="index-keyboard-macro_002c-terminating-1466"></a>This function discards the contents of the terminal input buffer and
cancels any keyboard macro that might be in the process of definition. 
It returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>In the following example, the user may type a number of characters right
after starting the evaluation of the form.  After the <code>sleep-for</code>
finishes sleeping, <code>discard-input</code> discards any characters typed
during the sleep.

     <pre class="example">          (progn (sleep-for 2)
                 (discard-input))
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
