<h3 class="section">28.24 Window Configurations</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-configurations-2456"></a><a name="index-saving-window-information-2457"></a>
A <dfn>window configuration</dfn> records the entire layout of one
frame&mdash;all windows, their sizes, which buffers they contain, how those
buffers are scrolled, and their values of point and the mark; also their
fringes, margins, and scroll bar settings.  It also includes the value
of <code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code>.  As a special exception, the window
configuration does not record the value of point in the selected window
for the current buffer.

   <p>You can bring back an entire frame layout by restoring a previously
saved window configuration.  If you want to record the layout of all
frames instead of just one, use a frame configuration instead of a
window configuration.  See <a href="Frame-Configurations.html#Frame-Configurations">Frame Configurations</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-window-configuration</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-current_002dwindow_002dconfiguration-2458"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a new object representing <var>frame</var>'s current
window configuration.  The default for <var>frame</var> is the selected
frame.  The variable <code>window-persistent-parameters</code> specifies
which window parameters (if any) are saved by this function. 
See <a href="Window-Parameters.html#Window-Parameters">Window Parameters</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-window-configuration</b><var> configuration<a name="index-set_002dwindow_002dconfiguration-2459"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function restores the configuration of windows and buffers as
specified by <var>configuration</var>, for the frame that <var>configuration</var>
was created for.

        <p>The argument <var>configuration</var> must be a value that was previously
returned by <code>current-window-configuration</code>.  The configuration is
restored in the frame from which <var>configuration</var> was made, whether
that frame is selected or not.  This always counts as a window size
change and triggers execution of the <code>window-size-change-functions</code>
(see <a href="Window-Hooks.html#Window-Hooks">Window Hooks</a>), because <code>set-window-configuration</code> doesn't
know how to tell whether the new configuration actually differs from the
old one.

        <p>If the frame from which <var>configuration</var> was saved is dead, all this
function does is restore the three variables <code>window-min-height</code>,
<code>window-min-width</code> and <code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code>.  In this
case, the function returns <code>nil</code>.  Otherwise, it returns <code>t</code>.

        <p>Here is a way of using this function to get the same effect
as <code>save-window-excursion</code>:

     <pre class="example">          (let ((config (current-window-configuration)))
            (unwind-protect
                (progn (split-window-below nil)
                       ...)
              (set-window-configuration config)))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>save-window-excursion</b><var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-save_002dwindow_002dexcursion-2460"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro records the window configuration of the selected frame,
executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then restores the earlier window
configuration.  The return value is the value of the final form in
<var>forms</var>.

        <p>Most Lisp code should not use this macro; <code>save-selected-window</code>
is typically sufficient.  In particular, this macro cannot reliably
prevent the code in <var>forms</var> from opening new windows, because new
windows might be opened in other frames (see <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>), and
<code>save-window-excursion</code> only saves and restores the window
configuration on the current frame.

        <p>Do not use this macro in <code>window-size-change-functions</code>; exiting
the macro triggers execution of <code>window-size-change-functions</code>,
leading to an endless loop. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-configuration-p</b><var> object<a name="index-window_002dconfiguration_002dp-2461"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a window configuration. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>compare-window-configurations</b><var> config1 config2<a name="index-compare_002dwindow_002dconfigurations-2462"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function compares two window configurations as regards the
structure of windows, but ignores the values of point and mark and the
saved scrolling positions&mdash;it can return <code>t</code> even if those
aspects differ.

        <p>The function <code>equal</code> can also compare two window configurations; it
regards configurations as unequal if they differ in any respect, even a
saved point or mark. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-configuration-frame</b><var> config<a name="index-window_002dconfiguration_002dframe-2463"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the frame for which the window configuration
<var>config</var> was made. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Other primitives to look inside of window configurations would make
sense, but are not implemented because we did not need them.  See the
file <samp><span class="file">winner.el</span></samp> for some more operations on windows
configurations.

   <p>The objects returned by <code>current-window-configuration</code> die
together with the Emacs process.  In order to store a window
configuration on disk and read it back in another Emacs session, you
can use the functions described next.  These functions are also useful
to clone the state of a frame into an arbitrary live window
(<code>set-window-configuration</code> effectively clones the windows of a
frame into the root window of that very frame only).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-state-get</b><var> &amp;optional window writable<a name="index-window_002dstate_002dget-2464"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the state of <var>window</var> as a Lisp object.  The
argument <var>window</var> must be a valid window and defaults to the root
window of the selected frame.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>writable</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this means to
not use markers for sampling positions like <code>window-point</code> or
<code>window-start</code>.  This argument should be non-<code>nil</code> when the
state will be written to disk and read back in another session.

        <p>Together, the argument <var>writable</var> and the variable
<code>window-persistent-parameters</code> specify which window parameters are
saved by this function.  See <a href="Window-Parameters.html#Window-Parameters">Window Parameters</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The value returned by <code>window-state-get</code> can be used in the same
session to make a clone of a window in another window.  It can be also
written to disk and read back in another session.  In either case, use
the following function to restore the state of the window.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-state-put</b><var> state &amp;optional window ignore<a name="index-window_002dstate_002dput-2465"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function puts the window state <var>state</var> into <var>window</var>.  The
argument <var>state</var> should be the state of a window returned by an
earlier invocation of <code>window-state-get</code>, see above.  The optional
argument <var>window</var> must specify a live window and defaults to the
selected one.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>ignore</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it means to ignore
minimum window sizes and fixed-size restrictions.  If <var>ignore</var>
is <code>safe</code>, this means windows can get as small as one line
and/or two columns. 
</p></blockquote></div>
