<h3 class="section">39.20 Dynamically Loaded Libraries</h3>

<p><a name="index-dynamic-libraries-4263"></a>
  A <dfn>dynamically loaded library</dfn> is a library that is loaded on
demand, when its facilities are first needed.  Emacs supports such
on-demand loading of support libraries for some of its features.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>dynamic-library-alist</b><var><a name="index-dynamic_002dlibrary_002dalist-4264"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is an alist of dynamic libraries and external library files
implementing them.

        <p>Each element is a list of the form
<code>(</code><var>library</var><code>&nbsp;</code><var>files</var><code>...)</code><!-- /@w -->, where the <code>car</code> is
a symbol representing a supported external library, and the rest are
strings giving alternate filenames for that library.

        <p>Emacs tries to load the library from the files in the order they
appear in the list; if none is found, the Emacs session won't have
access to that library, and the features it provides will be
unavailable.

        <p>Image support on some platforms uses this facility.  Here's an example
of setting this variable for supporting images on MS-Windows:

     <pre class="example">          (setq dynamic-library-alist
                '((xpm "libxpm.dll" "xpm4.dll" "libXpm-nox4.dll")
                  (png "libpng12d.dll" "libpng12.dll" "libpng.dll"
                       "libpng13d.dll" "libpng13.dll")
                  (jpeg "jpeg62.dll" "libjpeg.dll" "jpeg-62.dll"
                        "jpeg.dll")
                  (tiff "libtiff3.dll" "libtiff.dll")
                  (gif "giflib4.dll" "libungif4.dll" "libungif.dll")
                  (svg "librsvg-2-2.dll")
                  (gdk-pixbuf "libgdk_pixbuf-2.0-0.dll")
                  (glib "libglib-2.0-0.dll")
          	(gobject "libgobject-2.0-0.dll")))
</pre>
        <p>Note that image types <code>pbm</code> and <code>xbm</code> do not need entries in
this variable because they do not depend on external libraries and are
always available in Emacs.

        <p>Also note that this variable is not meant to be a generic facility for
accessing external libraries; only those already known by Emacs can
be loaded through it.

        <p>This variable is ignored if the given <var>library</var> is statically
linked into Emacs. 
</p></blockquote></div>
