<h3 class="section">28.2 Splitting Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-splitting-windows-2045"></a><a name="index-window-splitting-2046"></a>
The functions described below are the primitives used to split a window
into two windows.  They do not accept a buffer as an argument.  Rather,
the two &ldquo;halves&rdquo; of the split window initially display the same buffer
previously visible in the window that was split.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>split-window</b><var> &amp;optional window size horizontal<a name="index-split_002dwindow-2047"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function splits a new window out of <var>window</var>'s screen area.  It
returns the new window.  The default for <var>window</var> is the selected
window.  When you split the selected window, it remains selected.

        <p>If <var>horizontal</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <var>window</var> splits into two
side by side windows.  The original window keeps the leftmost <var>size</var>
columns, and gives the rest of the columns to the new window. 
Otherwise, <var>window</var> splits into windows one above the other, the
original window keeps the upper <var>size</var> lines and gives the rest of
the lines to the new window.  The original window <var>window</var> is
therefore the left-hand or upper of the two, and the new window is the
right-hand or lower.

        <p>If <var>size</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, then <var>window</var> is divided
evenly into two parts.  (If there is an odd line, it is allocated to
the new window.)  When <code>split-window</code> is called interactively,
all its arguments are <code>nil</code>.

        <p>If splitting would result in making a window that is smaller than
<code>window-min-height</code> or <code>window-min-width</code> (see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>), <code>split-window</code> signals an error and does not split the
window at all.

        <p>The following example starts with one window on a screen that is 50
lines high by 80 columns wide; then it splits the window.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (setq w (selected-window))
               &rArr; #&lt;window 8 on windows.texi&gt;
          (window-edges)          ; <span class="roman">Edges in order:</span>
               &rArr; (0 0 80 50)     ;   <span class="roman">left--top--right--bottom</span>
          
          ;; <span class="roman">Returns window created</span>
          (setq w2 (split-window w 15))
               &rArr; #&lt;window 28 on windows.texi&gt;
          (window-edges w2)
               &rArr; (0 15 80 50)    ; <span class="roman">Bottom window;</span>
                                  ;   <span class="roman">top is line 15</span>
          (window-edges w)
               &rArr; (0 0 80 15)     ; <span class="roman">Top window</span>
</pre>
        <p>The screen looks like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">                   __________
                  |          |  line 0
                  |    w     |
                  |__________|
                  |          |  line 15
                  |    w2    |
                  |__________|
                                line 50
           column 0   column 80
</pre>
        <p>Next, split the top window horizontally:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (setq w3 (split-window w 35 t))
               &rArr; #&lt;window 32 on windows.texi&gt;
          (window-edges w3)
               &rArr; (35 0 80 15)  ; <span class="roman">Left edge at column 35</span>
          (window-edges w)
               &rArr; (0 0 35 15)   ; <span class="roman">Right edge at column 35</span>
          (window-edges w2)
               &rArr; (0 15 80 50)  ; <span class="roman">Bottom window unchanged</span>
</pre>
        <p>Now the screen looks like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">               column 35
                   __________
                  |   |      |  line 0
                  | w |  w3  |
                  |___|______|
                  |          |  line 15
                  |    w2    |
                  |__________|
                                line 50
           column 0   column 80
</pre>
        <p>Normally, Emacs indicates the border between two side-by-side windows
with a scroll bar (see <a href="Scroll-Bars.html#Scroll-Bars">Scroll Bars</a>), or with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo; characters.  The
display table can specify alternative border characters; see <a href="Display-Tables.html#Display-Tables">Display Tables</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>split-window-vertically</b><var> &amp;optional size<a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dvertically-2048"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function splits the selected window into two windows, one above the
other, leaving the upper of the two windows selected, with <var>size</var>
lines.  (If <var>size</var> is negative, then the lower of the two windows
gets &minus;<var>size</var> lines and the upper window gets the rest, but
the upper window is still the one selected.)  However, if
<code>split-window-keep-point</code> (see below) is <code>nil</code>, then either
window can be selected.

        <p>In other respects, this function is similar to <code>split-window</code>. 
In particular, the upper window is the original one and the return
value is the new, lower window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>split-window-keep-point</b><var><a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dkeep_002dpoint-2049"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code> (the default), then
<code>split-window-vertically</code> behaves as described above.

        <p>If it is <code>nil</code>, then <code>split-window-vertically</code> adjusts point
in each of the two windows to avoid scrolling.  (This is useful on
slow terminals.)  It selects whichever window contains the screen line
that point was previously on.

        <p>This variable affects the behavior of <code>split-window-vertically</code>
only.  It has no effect on the other functions described here. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>split-window-horizontally</b><var> &amp;optional size<a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dhorizontally-2050"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function splits the selected window into two windows
side-by-side, leaving the selected window on the left with <var>size</var>
columns.  If <var>size</var> is negative, the rightmost window gets
&minus;<var>size</var> columns, but the leftmost window still remains
selected.

        <p>This function is basically an interface to <code>split-window</code>. 
You could define a simplified version of the function like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (defun split-window-horizontally (&amp;optional arg)
            "Split selected window into two windows, side by side..."
            (interactive "P")
            (let ((size (and arg (prefix-numeric-value arg))))
              (and size (&lt; size 0)
                   (setq size (+ (window-width) size)))
              (split-window nil size t)))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>one-window-p</b><var> &amp;optional no-mini all-frames<a name="index-one_002dwindow_002dp-2051"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns non-<code>nil</code> if there is only one window.  The
argument <var>no-mini</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means don't count the
minibuffer even if it is active; otherwise, the minibuffer window is
counted when it is active.

        <p>The argument <var>all-frames</var> specifies which frames to consider.  Here
are the possible values and their meanings:

          <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Count the windows in the selected frame, plus the minibuffer used
by that frame even if it lies in some other frame.

          <br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Count all windows in all existing frames.

          <br><dt><code>visible</code><dd>Count all windows in all visible frames.

          <br><dt>0<dd>Count all windows in all visible or iconified frames.

          <br><dt>anything else<dd>Count precisely the windows in the selected frame, and no others. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>
