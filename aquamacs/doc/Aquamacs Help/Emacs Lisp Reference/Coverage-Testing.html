<h4 class="subsection">18.2.13 Coverage Testing</h4>

<p><a name="index-coverage-testing-_0028Edebug_0029-1048"></a><a name="index-frequency-counts-1049"></a><a name="index-performance-analysis-1050"></a>  Edebug provides rudimentary coverage testing and display of execution
frequency.

   <p>Coverage testing works by comparing the result of each expression with
the previous result; each form in the program is considered &ldquo;covered&rdquo;
if it has returned two different values since you began testing coverage
in the current Emacs session.  Thus, to do coverage testing on your
program, execute it under various conditions and note whether it behaves
correctly; Edebug will tell you when you have tried enough different
conditions that each form has returned two different values.

   <p>Coverage testing makes execution slower, so it is only done if
<code>edebug-test-coverage</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  Frequency counting is
performed for all executions of an instrumented function, even if the
execution mode is Go-nonstop, and regardless of whether coverage testing
is enabled.

   <p><a name="index-C_002dx-X-_003d-1051"></a><a name="index-edebug_002dtemp_002ddisplay_002dfreq_002dcount-1052"></a>  Use <kbd>C-x X =</kbd> (<code>edebug-display-freq-count</code>) to display both
the coverage information and the frequency counts for a definition. 
Just <kbd>=</kbd> (<code>edebug-temp-display-freq-count</code>) displays the same
information temporarily, only until you type another key.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>edebug-display-freq-count</b><var><a name="index-edebug_002ddisplay_002dfreq_002dcount-1053"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command displays the frequency count data for each line of the
current definition.

        <p>It inserts frequency counts as comment lines after each line of code. 
You can undo all insertions with one <code>undo</code> command.  The counts
appear under the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; before an expression or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; after
an expression, or on the last character of a variable.  To simplify
the display, a count is not shown if it is equal to the count of an
earlier expression on the same line.

        <p>The character &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo; following the count for an expression says that
the expression has returned the same value each time it was evaluated. 
In other words, it is not yet &ldquo;covered&rdquo; for coverage testing purposes.

        <p>To clear the frequency count and coverage data for a definition,
simply reinstrument it with <code>eval-defun</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>For example, after evaluating <code>(fac 5)</code> with a source
breakpoint, and setting <code>edebug-test-coverage</code> to <code>t</code>, when
the breakpoint is reached, the frequency data looks like this:

<pre class="example">     (defun fac (n)
       (if (= n 0) (edebug))
     ;#6           1      = =5
       (if (&lt; 0 n)
     ;#5         =
           (* n (fac (1- n)))
     ;#    5               0
         1))
     ;#   0
</pre>
   <p>The comment lines show that <code>fac</code> was called 6 times.  The
first <code>if</code> statement returned 5 times with the same result each
time; the same is true of the condition on the second <code>if</code>. 
The recursive call of <code>fac</code> did not return at all.
