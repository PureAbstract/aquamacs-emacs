<h3 class="section">17.9 The Combined Definition</h3>

<p>Suppose that a function has <var>n</var> pieces of before-advice
(numbered from 0 through <var>n</var>&minus;1), <var>m</var> pieces of
around-advice and <var>k</var> pieces of after-advice.  Assuming no piece
of advice is protected, the combined definition produced to implement
the advice for a function looks like this:

<pre class="example">     (lambda <var>arglist</var>
       <span class="roman">[</span> <span class="roman">[</span><var>advised-docstring</var><span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">[</span>(interactive ...)<span class="roman">]</span> <span class="roman">]</span>
       (let (ad-return-value)
         <span class="roman">before-0-body-form</span>...
              ....
         <span class="roman">before-</span><var>n</var><span class="roman">&minus;1-body-form</span>...
         <span class="roman">around-0-body-form</span>...
            <span class="roman">around-1-body-form</span>...
                  ....
               <span class="roman">around-</span><var>m</var><span class="roman">&minus;1-body-form</span>...
                  (setq ad-return-value
                        <span class="roman">apply original definition to </span><var>arglist</var>)
               <span class="roman">end-of-around-</span><var>m</var><span class="roman">&minus;1-body-form</span>...
                  ....
            <span class="roman">end-of-around-1-body-form</span>...
         <span class="roman">end-of-around-0-body-form</span>...
         <span class="roman">after-0-body-form</span>...
               ....
         <span class="roman">after-</span><var>k</var><span class="roman">&minus;1-body-form</span>...
         ad-return-value))
</pre>
   <p>Macros are redefined as macros, which means adding <code>macro</code> to
the beginning of the combined definition.

   <p>The interactive form is present if the original function or some piece
of advice specifies one.  When an interactive primitive function is
advised, advice uses a special method: it calls the primitive with
<code>call-interactively</code> so that it will read its own arguments. 
In this case, the advice cannot access the arguments.

   <p>The body forms of the various advice in each class are assembled
according to their specified order.  The forms of around-advice <var>l</var>
are included in one of the forms of around-advice <var>l</var> &minus; 1.

   <p>The innermost part of the around advice onion is

<pre class="display">     apply original definition to <var>arglist</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">whose form depends on the type of the original function.  The variable
<code>ad-return-value</code> is set to whatever this returns.  The variable is
visible to all pieces of advice, which can access and modify it before
it is actually returned from the advised function.

   <p>The semantic structure of advised functions that contain protected
pieces of advice is the same.  The only difference is that
<code>unwind-protect</code> forms ensure that the protected advice gets
executed even if some previous piece of advice had an error or a
non-local exit.  If any around-advice is protected, then the whole
around-advice onion is protected as a result.
