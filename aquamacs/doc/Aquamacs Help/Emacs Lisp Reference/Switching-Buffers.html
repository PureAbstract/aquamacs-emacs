<h3 class="section">28.11 Switching to a Buffer in a Window</h3>

<p><a name="index-switching-to-a-buffer-2346"></a><a name="index-displaying-a-buffer-2347"></a>
This section describes high-level functions for switching to a specified
buffer in some window.  In general, &ldquo;switching to a buffer&rdquo; means to
(1) show the buffer in some window, (2) make that window the selected
window (and its frame the selected frame), and (3) make the buffer the
current buffer.

   <p>Do <em>not</em> use these functions to make a buffer temporarily
current just so a Lisp program can access or modify it.  They have
side-effects, such as changing window histories (see <a href="Window-History.html#Window-History">Window History</a>), which will surprise the user if used that way.  If you want
to make a buffer current to modify it in Lisp, use
<code>with-current-buffer</code>, <code>save-current-buffer</code>, or
<code>set-buffer</code>.  See <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>switch-to-buffer</b><var> buffer-or-name &amp;optional norecord force-same-window<a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer-2348"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command attempts to display <var>buffer-or-name</var> in the selected
window and make it the current buffer.  It is often used interactively
(as the binding of <kbd>C-x b</kbd>), as well as in Lisp programs.  The
return value is the buffer switched to.

        <p>If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the buffer
returned by <code>other-buffer</code> (see <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>).  If
<var>buffer-or-name</var> is a string that is not the name of any existing
buffer, this function creates a new buffer with that name; the new
buffer's major mode is determined by the variable <code>major-mode</code>
(see <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).

        <p>Normally, the specified buffer is put at the front of the buffer
list&mdash;both the global buffer list and the selected frame's buffer
list (see <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>).  However, this is not done if the
optional argument <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.

        <p>Sometimes, <code>switch-to-buffer</code> may be unable to display the buffer
in the selected window.  This happens if the selected window is a
minibuffer window, or if the selected window is strongly dedicated to
its buffer (see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>).  In that case, the command
normally tries to display the buffer in some other window, by invoking
<code>pop-to-buffer</code> (see below).  However, if the optional argument
<var>force-same-window</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it signals an error
instead. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>By default, <code>switch-to-buffer</code> shows the buffer at its position of
<code>point</code>.  This behavior can be tuned using the following option.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>switch-to-buffer-preserve-window-point</b><var><a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer_002dpreserve_002dwindow_002dpoint-2349"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, <code>switch-to-buffer</code> displays the
buffer specified by <var>buffer-or-name</var> at the position of that
buffer's <code>point</code>.  If this variable is <code>already-displayed</code>, it
tries to display the buffer at its previous position in the selected
window, provided the buffer is currently displayed in some other window
on any visible or iconified frame.  If this variable is <code>t</code>,
<code>switch-to-buffer</code> unconditionally tries to display the buffer at
its previous position in the selected window.

        <p>This variable is ignored if the buffer is already displayed in the
selected window or never appeared in it before, or if
<code>switch-to-buffer</code> calls <code>pop-to-buffer</code> to display the
buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The next two commands are similar to <code>switch-to-buffer</code>, except for
the described features.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>switch-to-buffer-other-window</b><var> buffer-or-name &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer_002dother_002dwindow-2350"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function displays the buffer specified by <var>buffer-or-name</var> in
some window other than the selected window.  It uses the function
<code>pop-to-buffer</code> internally (see below).

        <p>If the selected window already displays the specified buffer, it
continues to do so, but another window is nonetheless found to display
it as well.

        <p>The <var>buffer-or-name</var> and <var>norecord</var> arguments have the same
meanings as in <code>switch-to-buffer</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>switch-to-buffer-other-frame</b><var> buffer-or-name &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-switch_002dto_002dbuffer_002dother_002dframe-2351"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function displays the buffer specified by <var>buffer-or-name</var> in a
new frame.  It uses the function <code>pop-to-buffer</code> internally (see
below).

        <p>If the specified buffer is already displayed in another window, in any
frame on the current terminal, this switches to that window instead of
creating a new frame.  However, the selected window is never used for
this.

        <p>The <var>buffer-or-name</var> and <var>norecord</var> arguments have the same
meanings as in <code>switch-to-buffer</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The above commands use the function <code>pop-to-buffer</code>, which
flexibly displays a buffer in some window and selects that window for
editing.  In turn, <code>pop-to-buffer</code> uses <code>display-buffer</code> for
displaying the buffer.  Hence, all the variables affecting
<code>display-buffer</code> will affect it as well.  See <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>,
for the documentation of <code>display-buffer</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>pop-to-buffer</b><var> buffer-or-name &amp;optional action norecord<a name="index-pop_002dto_002dbuffer-2352"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>buffer-or-name</var> the current buffer and
displays it in some window, preferably not the window previously
selected.  It then selects the displaying window.  If that window is
on a different graphical frame, that frame is given input focus if
possible (see <a href="Input-Focus.html#Input-Focus">Input Focus</a>).  The return value is the buffer that
was switched to.

        <p>If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the buffer
returned by <code>other-buffer</code> (see <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>).  If
<var>buffer-or-name</var> is a string that is not the name of any existing
buffer, this function creates a new buffer with that name; the new
buffer's major mode is determined by the variable <code>major-mode</code>
(see <a href="Major-Modes.html#Major-Modes">Major Modes</a>).

        <p>If <var>action</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a display action to
pass to <code>display-buffer</code> (see <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>). 
Alternatively, a non-<code>nil</code>, non-list value means to pop to a
window other than the selected one&mdash;even if the buffer is already
displayed in the selected window.

        <p>Like <code>switch-to-buffer</code>, this function updates the buffer list
unless <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>
