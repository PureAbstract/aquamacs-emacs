<h3 class="section">33.1 Text Representations</h3>

<p><a name="index-text-representation-3126"></a>
  Emacs buffers and strings support a large repertoire of characters
from many different scripts, allowing users to type and display text
in almost any known written language.

   <p><a name="index-character-codepoint-3127"></a><a name="index-codespace-3128"></a><a name="index-Unicode-3129"></a>  To support this multitude of characters and scripts, Emacs closely
follows the <dfn>Unicode Standard</dfn>.  The Unicode Standard assigns a
unique number, called a <dfn>codepoint</dfn>, to each and every character. 
The range of codepoints defined by Unicode, or the Unicode
<dfn>codespace</dfn>, is <code>0..#x10FFFF</code> (in hexadecimal notation),
inclusive.  Emacs extends this range with codepoints in the range
<code>#x110000..#x3FFFFF</code>, which it uses for representing characters
that are not unified with Unicode and <dfn>raw 8-bit bytes</dfn> that
cannot be interpreted as characters.  Thus, a character codepoint in
Emacs is a 22-bit integer number.

   <p><a name="index-internal-representation-of-characters-3130"></a><a name="index-characters_002c-representation-in-buffers-and-strings-3131"></a><a name="index-multibyte-text-3132"></a>  To conserve memory, Emacs does not hold fixed-length 22-bit numbers
that are codepoints of text characters within buffers and strings. 
Rather, Emacs uses a variable-length internal representation of
characters, that stores each character as a sequence of 1 to 5 8-bit
bytes, depending on the magnitude of its codepoint<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  For example, any <acronym>ASCII</acronym> character takes up only 1
byte, a Latin-1 character takes up 2 bytes, etc.  We call this
representation of text <dfn>multibyte</dfn>.

   <p>Outside Emacs, characters can be represented in many different
encodings, such as ISO-8859-1, GB-2312, Big-5, etc.  Emacs converts
between these external encodings and its internal representation, as
appropriate, when it reads text into a buffer or a string, or when it
writes text to a disk file or passes it to some other process.

   <p>Occasionally, Emacs needs to hold and manipulate encoded text or
binary non-text data in its buffers or strings.  For example, when
Emacs visits a file, it first reads the file's text verbatim into a
buffer, and only then converts it to the internal representation. 
Before the conversion, the buffer holds encoded text.

   <p><a name="index-unibyte-text-3133"></a>  Encoded text is not really text, as far as Emacs is concerned, but
rather a sequence of raw 8-bit bytes.  We call buffers and strings
that hold encoded text <dfn>unibyte</dfn> buffers and strings, because
Emacs treats them as a sequence of individual bytes.  Usually, Emacs
displays unibyte buffers and strings as octal codes such as
<code>\237</code>.  We recommend that you never use unibyte buffers and
strings except for manipulating encoded text or binary non-text data.

   <p>In a buffer, the buffer-local value of the variable
<code>enable-multibyte-characters</code> specifies the representation used. 
The representation for a string is determined and recorded in the string
when the string is constructed.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>enable-multibyte-characters</b><var><a name="index-enable_002dmultibyte_002dcharacters-3134"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies the current buffer's text representation. 
If it is non-<code>nil</code>, the buffer contains multibyte text; otherwise,
it contains unibyte encoded text or binary non-text data.

        <p>You cannot set this variable directly; instead, use the function
<code>set-buffer-multibyte</code> to change a buffer's representation. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>position-bytes</b><var> position<a name="index-position_002dbytes-3135"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Buffer positions are measured in character units.  This function
returns the byte-position corresponding to buffer position
<var>position</var> in the current buffer.  This is 1 at the start of the
buffer, and counts upward in bytes.  If <var>position</var> is out of
range, the value is <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>byte-to-position</b><var> byte-position<a name="index-byte_002dto_002dposition-3136"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the buffer position, in character units, corresponding to given
<var>byte-position</var> in the current buffer.  If <var>byte-position</var> is
out of range, the value is <code>nil</code>.  In a multibyte buffer, an
arbitrary value of <var>byte-position</var> can be not at character
boundary, but inside a multibyte sequence representing a single
character; in this case, this function returns the buffer position of
the character whose multibyte sequence includes <var>byte-position</var>. 
In other words, the value does not change for all byte positions that
belong to the same character. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>multibyte-string-p</b><var> string<a name="index-multibyte_002dstring_002dp-3137"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return <code>t</code> if <var>string</var> is a multibyte string, <code>nil</code>
otherwise.  This function also returns <code>nil</code> if <var>string</var> is
some object other than a string. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>string-bytes</b><var> string<a name="index-string_002dbytes-3138"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-string_002c-number-of-bytes-3139"></a>This function returns the number of bytes in <var>string</var>. 
If <var>string</var> is a multibyte string, this can be greater than
<code>(length </code><var>string</var><code>)</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>unibyte-string</b><var> &amp;rest bytes<a name="index-unibyte_002dstring-3140"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function concatenates all its argument <var>bytes</var> and makes the
result a unibyte string.

This internal representation is based on one of the encodings defined
by the Unicode Standard, called <dfn>UTF-8</dfn>, for representing any
Unicode codepoint, but Emacs extends UTF-8 to represent the additional
codepoints it uses for raw 8-bit bytes and characters not unified with
Unicode.</p>
