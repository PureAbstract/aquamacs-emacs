<h3 class="section">5.1 Lists and Cons Cells</h3>

<p><a name="index-lists-and-cons-cells-289"></a>
  Lists in Lisp are not a primitive data type; they are built up from
<dfn>cons cells</dfn>.  A cons cell is a data object that represents an
ordered pair.  That is, it has two slots, and each slot <dfn>holds</dfn>, or
<dfn>refers to</dfn>, some Lisp object.  One slot is known as the <span class="sc">car</span>,
and the other is known as the <span class="sc">cdr</span>.  (These names are traditional;
see <a href="Cons-Cell-Type.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell Type</a>.)  <span class="sc">cdr</span> is pronounced &ldquo;could-er.&rdquo;

   <p>We say that &ldquo;the <span class="sc">car</span> of this cons cell is&rdquo; whatever object
its <span class="sc">car</span> slot currently holds, and likewise for the <span class="sc">cdr</span>.

   <p>A list is a series of cons cells &ldquo;chained together,&rdquo; so that each
cell refers to the next one.  There is one cons cell for each element of
the list.  By convention, the <span class="sc">car</span>s of the cons cells hold the
elements of the list, and the <span class="sc">cdr</span>s are used to chain the list: the
<span class="sc">cdr</span> slot of each cons cell refers to the following cons cell.  The
<span class="sc">cdr</span> of the last cons cell is <code>nil</code>.  This asymmetry between
the <span class="sc">car</span> and the <span class="sc">cdr</span> is entirely a matter of convention; at the
level of cons cells, the <span class="sc">car</span> and <span class="sc">cdr</span> slots have the same
characteristics.

   <p><a name="index-true-list-290"></a>  Since <code>nil</code> is the conventional value to put in the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of
the last cons cell in the list, we call that case a <dfn>true list</dfn>.

   <p>In Lisp, we consider the symbol <code>nil</code> a list as well as a
symbol; it is the list with no elements.  For convenience, the symbol
<code>nil</code> is considered to have <code>nil</code> as its <span class="sc">cdr</span> (and also
as its <span class="sc">car</span>).  Therefore, the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a true list is always a
true list.

   <p><a name="index-dotted-list-291"></a><a name="index-circular-list-292"></a>  If the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of a list's last cons cell is some other value,
neither <code>nil</code> nor another cons cell, we call the structure a
<dfn>dotted list</dfn>, since its printed representation would use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;.  There is one other possibility: some cons cell's <span class="sc">cdr</span>
could point to one of the previous cons cells in the list.  We call
that structure a <dfn>circular list</dfn>.

   <p>For some purposes, it does not matter whether a list is true,
circular or dotted.  If the program doesn't look far enough down the
list to see the <span class="sc">cdr</span> of the final cons cell, it won't care. 
However, some functions that operate on lists demand true lists and
signal errors if given a dotted list.  Most functions that try to find
the end of a list enter infinite loops if given a circular list.

   <p><a name="index-list-structure-293"></a>  Because most cons cells are used as part of lists, the phrase
<dfn>list structure</dfn> has come to mean any structure made out of cons
cells.

   <p>The <span class="sc">cdr</span> of any nonempty true list <var>l</var> is a list containing all the
elements of <var>l</var> except the first.

   <p>See <a href="Cons-Cell-Type.html#Cons-Cell-Type">Cons Cell Type</a>, for the read and print syntax of cons cells and
lists, and for &ldquo;box and arrow&rdquo; illustrations of lists.
