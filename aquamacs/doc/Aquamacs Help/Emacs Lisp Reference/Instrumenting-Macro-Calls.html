<h5 class="subsubsection">18.2.15.1 Instrumenting Macro Calls</h5>

<p>When Edebug instruments an expression that calls a Lisp macro, it needs
additional information about the macro to do the job properly.  This is
because there is no a-priori way to tell which subexpressions of the
macro call are forms to be evaluated.  (Evaluation may occur explicitly
in the macro body, or when the resulting expansion is evaluated, or any
time later.)

   <p>Therefore, you must define an Edebug specification for each macro
that Edebug will encounter, to explain the format of calls to that
macro.  To do this, add a <code>debug</code> declaration to the macro
definition.  Here is a simple example that shows the specification for
the <code>for</code> example macro (see <a href="Argument-Evaluation.html#Argument-Evaluation">Argument Evaluation</a>).

<pre class="smallexample">     (defmacro for (var from init to final do &amp;rest body)
       "Execute a simple \"for\" loop.
     For example, (for i from 1 to 10 do (print i))."
       (declare (debug (symbolp "from" form "to" form "do" &amp;rest form)))
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>The Edebug specification says which parts of a call to the macro are
forms to be evaluated.  For simple macros, the specification
often looks very similar to the formal argument list of the macro
definition, but specifications are much more general than macro
arguments.  See <a href="Defining-Macros.html#Defining-Macros">Defining Macros</a>, for more explanation of
the <code>declare</code> form.

<!-- See, e.g., http://debbugs.gnu.org/10577 -->
<!-- FIXME  Maybe there should be an Edebug option to get it to -->
<!-- automatically load the entire source file containing the function -->
<!-- being instrumented.  That would avoid this. -->
   <p>Take care to ensure that the specifications are known to Edebug when
you instrument code.  If you are instrumenting a function from a file
that uses <code>eval-when-compile</code> to require another file containing
macro definitions, you may need to explicitly load that file.

   <p>You can also define an edebug specification for a macro separately
from the macro definition with <code>def-edebug-spec</code>.  Adding
<code>debug</code> declarations is preferred, and more convenient, for macro
definitions in Lisp, but <code>def-edebug-spec</code> makes it possible to
define Edebug specifications for special forms implemented in C.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>def-edebug-spec</b><var> macro specification<a name="index-def_002dedebug_002dspec-1056"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Specify which expressions of a call to macro <var>macro</var> are forms to be
evaluated.  <var>specification</var> should be the edebug specification. 
Neither argument is evaluated.

        <p>The <var>macro</var> argument can actually be any symbol, not just a macro
name. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here is a table of the possibilities for <var>specification</var> and how each
directs processing of arguments.

     <dl>
<dt><code>t</code><dd>All arguments are instrumented for evaluation.

     <br><dt><code>0</code><dd>None of the arguments is instrumented.

     <br><dt>a symbol<dd>The symbol must have an Edebug specification, which is used instead. 
This indirection is repeated until another kind of specification is
found.  This allows you to inherit the specification from another macro.

     <br><dt>a list<dd>The elements of the list describe the types of the arguments of a
calling form.  The possible elements of a specification list are
described in the following sections. 
</dl>

   <p>If a macro has no Edebug specification, neither through a <code>debug</code>
declaration nor through a <code>def-edebug-spec</code> call, the variable
<code>edebug-eval-macro-args</code> comes into play.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>edebug-eval-macro-args</b><var><a name="index-edebug_002deval_002dmacro_002dargs-1057"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This controls the way Edebug treats macro arguments with no explicit
Edebug specification.  If it is <code>nil</code> (the default), none of the
arguments is instrumented for evaluation.  Otherwise, all arguments
are instrumented. 
</p></blockquote></div>
