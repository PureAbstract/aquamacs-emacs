<h4 class="subsection">10.2.1 Pattern matching case statement</h4>

<p><a name="index-pcase-557"></a><a name="index-pattern-matching-558"></a>
To compare a particular value against various possible cases, the macro
<code>pcase</code> can come handy.  It takes the following form:

<pre class="example">     (pcase <var>exp</var> <var>branch</var>1 <var>branch</var>2 <var>branch</var>3 ...)
</pre>
   <p>where each <var>branch</var> takes the form <code>(</code><var>upattern</var>
<var>body-forms</var><code>...)</code>.

   <p>It will first evaluate <var>exp</var> and then compare the value against each
<var>upattern</var> to see which <var>branch</var> to use, after which it will run the
corresponding <var>body-forms</var>.  A common use case is to distinguish
between a few different constant values:

<pre class="example">     (pcase (get-return-code x)
       (`success       (message "Done!"))
       (`would-block   (message "Sorry, can't do it now"))
       (`read-only     (message "The shmliblick is read-only"))
       (`access-denied (message "You do not have the needed rights"))
       (code           (message "Unknown return code %S" code)))
</pre>
   <p>In the last clause, <code>code</code> is a variable that gets bound to the value that
was returned by <code>(get-return-code x)</code>.

   <p>To give a more complex example, a simple interpreter for a little
expression language could look like:

<pre class="example">     (defun evaluate (exp env)
       (pcase exp
         (`(add ,x ,y)         (+ (evaluate x env) (evaluate y env)))
         (`(call ,fun ,arg)    (funcall (evaluate fun) (evaluate arg env)))
         (`(fn ,arg ,body)     (lambda (val)
                                 (evaluate body (cons (cons arg val) env))))
         ((pred numberp)       exp)
         ((pred symbolp)       (cdr (assq exp env)))
         (_                    (error "Unknown expression %S" exp))))
</pre>
   <p>Where <code>`(add ,x ,y)</code> is a pattern that checks that <code>exp</code> is a three
element list starting with the symbol <code>add</code>, then extracts the second and
third elements and binds them to the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. 
<code>(pred numberp)</code> is a pattern that simply checks that <code>exp</code>
is a number, and <code>_</code> is the catch-all pattern that matches anything.

   <p>There are two kinds of patterns involved in <code>pcase</code>, called
<em>U-patterns</em> and <em>Q-patterns</em>.  The <var>upattern</var> mentioned above
are U-patterns and can take the following forms:

     <dl>
<dt><code>`</code><var>qpattern</var><dd>This is one of the most common form of patterns.  The intention is to mimic the
backquote macro: this pattern matches those values that could have been built
by such a backquote expression.  Since we're pattern matching rather than
building a value, the unquote does not indicate where to plug an expression,
but instead it lets one specify a U-pattern that should match the value at
that location.

     <p>More specifically, a Q-pattern can take the following forms:
          <dl>
<dt><code>(</code><var>qpattern1</var><code> . </code><var>qpattern2</var><code>)</code><dd>This pattern matches any cons cell whose <code>car</code> matches <var>QPATTERN1</var> and
whose <code>cdr</code> matches <var>PATTERN2</var>. 
<br><dt><var>atom</var><dd>This pattern matches any atom <code>equal</code> to <var>atom</var>. 
<br><dt><code>,</code><var>upattern</var><dd>This pattern matches any object that matches the <var>upattern</var>. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><var>symbol</var><dd>A mere symbol in a U-pattern matches anything, and additionally let-binds this
symbol to the value that it matched, so that you can later refer to it, either
in the <var>body-forms</var> or also later in the pattern. 
<br><dt><code>_</code><dd>This so-called <em>don't care</em> pattern matches anything, like the previous
one, but unlike symbol patterns it does not bind any variable. 
<br><dt><code>(pred </code><var>pred</var><code>)</code><dd>This pattern matches if the function <var>pred</var> returns non-<code>nil</code> when
called with the object being matched. 
<br><dt><code>(or </code><var>upattern1</var> <var>upattern2</var><code>...)</code><dd>This pattern matches as soon as one of the argument patterns succeeds. 
All argument patterns should let-bind the same variables. 
<br><dt><code>(and </code><var>upattern1</var> <var>upattern2</var><code>...)</code><dd>This pattern matches only if all the argument patterns succeed. 
<br><dt><code>(guard </code><var>exp</var><code>)</code><dd>This pattern ignores the object being examined and simply succeeds if <var>exp</var>
evaluates to non-<code>nil</code> and fails otherwise.  It is typically used inside
an <code>and</code> pattern.  For example, <code>(and x (guard (&lt; x 10)))</code>
is a pattern which matches any number smaller than 10 and let-binds it to
the variable <code>x</code>.
