<h3 class="section">28.16 Dedicated Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-dedicated-window-2387"></a>
Functions for displaying a buffer can be told to not use specific
windows by marking these windows as <dfn>dedicated</dfn> to their buffers. 
<code>display-buffer</code> (see <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>) never uses a dedicated
window for displaying another buffer in it.  <code>get-lru-window</code> and
<code>get-largest-window</code> (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>) do not
consider dedicated windows as candidates when their <var>dedicated</var>
argument is non-<code>nil</code>.  The behavior of <code>set-window-buffer</code>
(see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>) with respect to dedicated windows is
slightly different, see below.

   <p>Functions supposed to remove a buffer from a window or a window from
a frame can behave specially when a window they operate on is dedicated. 
We will distinguish three basic cases, namely where (1) the window is
not the only window on its frame, (2) the window is the only window on
its frame but there are other frames on the same terminal left, and (3)
the window is the only window on the only frame on the same terminal.

   <p>In particular, <code>delete-windows-on</code> (see <a href="Deleting-Windows.html#Deleting-Windows">Deleting Windows</a>)
handles case (2) by deleting the associated frame and case (3) by
showing another buffer in that frame's only window.  The function
<code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code> (see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>) which is
called when a buffer gets killed, deletes the window in case (1) and
behaves like <code>delete-windows-on</code> otherwise. 
<!-- FIXME: Does replace-buffer-in-windows _delete_ a window in case (1)? -->

   <p>When <code>bury-buffer</code> (see <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>) operates on the
selected window (which shows the buffer that shall be buried), it
handles case (2) by calling <code>frame-auto-hide-function</code>
(see <a href="Quitting-Windows.html#Quitting-Windows">Quitting Windows</a>) to deal with the selected frame.  The other
two cases are handled as with <code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-dedicated-p</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002ddedicated_002dp-2388"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns non-<code>nil</code> if <var>window</var> is dedicated to its
buffer and <code>nil</code> otherwise.  More precisely, the return value is
the value assigned by the last call of <code>set-window-dedicated-p</code> for
<var>window</var>, or <code>nil</code> if that function was never called with
<var>window</var> as its argument.  The default for <var>window</var> is the
selected window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-window-dedicated-p</b><var> window flag<a name="index-set_002dwindow_002ddedicated_002dp-2389"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function marks <var>window</var> as dedicated to its buffer if
<var>flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, and non-dedicated otherwise.

        <p>As a special case, if <var>flag</var> is <code>t</code>, <var>window</var> becomes
<dfn>strongly</dfn> dedicated to its buffer.  <code>set-window-buffer</code>
signals an error when the window it acts upon is strongly dedicated to
its buffer and does not already display the buffer it is asked to
display.  Other functions do not treat <code>t</code> differently from any
non-<code>nil</code> value.
