<h3 class="section">11.5 Defining Global Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-variable-definition-631"></a>
  A <dfn>variable definition</dfn> is a construct that announces your
intention to use a symbol as a global variable.  It uses the special
forms <code>defvar</code> or <code>defconst</code>, which are documented below.

   <p>A variable definition serves three purposes.  First, it informs
people who read the code that the symbol is <em>intended</em> to be used
a certain way (as a variable).  Second, it informs the Lisp system of
this, optionally supplying an initial value and a documentation
string.  Third, it provides information to programming tools such as
<samp><span class="command">etags</span></samp>, allowing them to find where the variable was defined.

   <p>The difference between <code>defconst</code> and <code>defvar</code> is mainly a
matter of intent, serving to inform human readers of whether the value
should ever change.  Emacs Lisp does not actually prevent you from
changing the value of a variable defined with <code>defconst</code>.  One
notable difference between the two forms is that <code>defconst</code>
unconditionally initializes the variable, whereas <code>defvar</code>
initializes it only if it is originally void.

   <p>To define a customizable variable, you should use <code>defcustom</code>
(which calls <code>defvar</code> as a subroutine).  See <a href="Variable-Definitions.html#Variable-Definitions">Variable Definitions</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>defvar</b><var> symbol </var>[<var>value </var>[<var>doc-string</var>]]<var><a name="index-defvar-632"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form defines <var>symbol</var> as a variable.  Note that
<var>symbol</var> is not evaluated; the symbol to be defined should appear
explicitly in the <code>defvar</code> form.  The variable is marked as
<dfn>special</dfn>, meaning that it should always be dynamically bound
(see <a href="Variable-Scoping.html#Variable-Scoping">Variable Scoping</a>).

        <p>If <var>symbol</var> is void and <var>value</var> is specified, <code>defvar</code>
evaluates <var>value</var> and sets <var>symbol</var> to the result.  But if
<var>symbol</var> already has a value (i.e., it is not void), <var>value</var>
is not even evaluated, and <var>symbol</var>'s value remains unchanged.  If
<var>value</var> is omitted, the value of <var>symbol</var> is not changed in
any case.

        <p>If <var>symbol</var> has a buffer-local binding in the current buffer,
<code>defvar</code> operates on the default value, which is buffer-independent,
not the current (buffer-local) binding.  It sets the default value if
the default value is void.  See <a href="Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html#Buffer_002dLocal-Variables">Buffer-Local Variables</a>.

        <p>When you evaluate a top-level <code>defvar</code> form with <kbd>C-M-x</kbd> in
Emacs Lisp mode (<code>eval-defun</code>), a special feature of
<code>eval-defun</code> arranges to set the variable unconditionally, without
testing whether its value is void.

        <p>If the <var>doc-string</var> argument is supplied, it specifies the
documentation string for the variable (stored in the symbol's
<code>variable-documentation</code> property).  See <a href="Documentation.html#Documentation">Documentation</a>.

        <p>Here are some examples.  This form defines <code>foo</code> but does not
initialize it:

     <pre class="example">          (defvar foo)
               &rArr; foo
</pre>
        <p>This example initializes the value of <code>bar</code> to <code>23</code>, and gives
it a documentation string:

     <pre class="example">          (defvar bar 23
            "The normal weight of a bar.")
               &rArr; bar
</pre>
        <p>The <code>defvar</code> form returns <var>symbol</var>, but it is normally used
at top level in a file where its value does not matter. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>defconst</b><var> symbol value </var>[<var>doc-string</var>]<var><a name="index-defconst-634"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form defines <var>symbol</var> as a value and initializes it. 
It informs a person reading your code that <var>symbol</var> has a standard
global value, established here, that should not be changed by the user
or by other programs.  Note that <var>symbol</var> is not evaluated; the
symbol to be defined must appear explicitly in the <code>defconst</code>.

        <p>The <code>defconst</code> form, like <code>defvar</code>, marks the variable as
<dfn>special</dfn>, meaning that it should always be dynamically bound
(see <a href="Variable-Scoping.html#Variable-Scoping">Variable Scoping</a>).  In addition, it marks the variable as
risky (see <a href="File-Local-Variables.html#File-Local-Variables">File Local Variables</a>).

        <p><code>defconst</code> always evaluates <var>value</var>, and sets the value of
<var>symbol</var> to the result.  If <var>symbol</var> does have a buffer-local
binding in the current buffer, <code>defconst</code> sets the default value,
not the buffer-local value.  (But you should not be making
buffer-local bindings for a symbol that is defined with
<code>defconst</code>.)

        <p>An example of the use of <code>defconst</code> is Emacs's definition of
<code>float-pi</code>&mdash;the mathematical constant pi, which ought not
to be changed by anyone (attempts by the Indiana State Legislature
notwithstanding).  As the second form illustrates, however,
<code>defconst</code> is only advisory.

     <pre class="example">          (defconst float-pi 3.141592653589793 "The value of Pi.")
               &rArr; float-pi
          (setq float-pi 3)
               &rArr; float-pi
          float-pi
               &rArr; 3
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you use a <code>defconst</code> or <code>defvar</code>
special form while the variable has a local binding (made with
<code>let</code>, or a function argument), it sets the local binding rather
than the global binding.  This is not what you usually want.  To
prevent this, use these special forms at top level in a file, where
normally no local binding is in effect, and make sure to load the file
before making a local binding for the variable.
