<h3 class="section">4.7 Formatting Strings</h3>

<p><a name="index-formatting-strings-268"></a><a name="index-strings_002c-formatting-them-269"></a>
  <dfn>Formatting</dfn> means constructing a string by substituting
computed values at various places in a constant string.  This constant
string controls how the other values are printed, as well as where
they appear; it is called a <dfn>format string</dfn>.

   <p>Formatting is often useful for computing messages to be displayed.  In
fact, the functions <code>message</code> and <code>error</code> provide the same
formatting feature described here; they differ from <code>format</code> only
in how they use the result of formatting.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>format</b><var> string &amp;rest objects<a name="index-format-270"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a new string that is made by copying
<var>string</var> and then replacing any format specification
in the copy with encodings of the corresponding <var>objects</var>.  The
arguments <var>objects</var> are the computed values to be formatted.

        <p>The characters in <var>string</var>, other than the format specifications,
are copied directly into the output, including their text properties,
if any. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0025_007d-in-format-271"></a><a name="index-format-specification-272"></a>  A format specification is a sequence of characters beginning with a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Thus, if there is a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo; in <var>string</var>, the
<code>format</code> function replaces it with the printed representation of
one of the values to be formatted (one of the arguments <var>objects</var>). 
For example:

<pre class="example">     (format "The value of fill-column is %d." fill-column)
          &rArr; "The value of fill-column is 72."
</pre>
   <p>Since <code>format</code> interprets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; characters as format
specifications, you should <em>never</em> pass an arbitrary string as
the first argument.  This is particularly true when the string is
generated by some Lisp code.  Unless the string is <em>known</em> to
never include any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, pass <code>"%s"</code>, described
below, as the first argument, and the string as the second, like this:

<pre class="example">       (format "%s" <var>arbitrary-string</var>)
</pre>
   <p>If <var>string</var> contains more than one format specification, the
format specifications correspond to successive values from
<var>objects</var>.  Thus, the first format specification in <var>string</var>
uses the first such value, the second format specification uses the
second such value, and so on.  Any extra format specifications (those
for which there are no corresponding values) cause an error.  Any
extra values to be formatted are ignored.

   <p>Certain format specifications require values of particular types.  If
you supply a value that doesn't fit the requirements, an error is
signaled.

   <p>Here is a table of valid format specifications:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Replace the specification with the printed representation of the object,
made without quoting (that is, using <code>princ</code>, not
<code>prin1</code>&mdash;see <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>).  Thus, strings are represented
by their contents alone, with no &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, and symbols appear
without &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; characters.

     <p>If the object is a string, its text properties are
copied into the output.  The text properties of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; itself
are also copied, but those of the object take priority.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%S</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Replace the specification with the printed representation of the object,
made with quoting (that is, using <code>prin1</code>&mdash;see <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>).  Thus, strings are enclosed in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>&rsquo; characters, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>&rsquo; characters appear where necessary before special characters.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-integer-to-octal-273"></a>Replace the specification with the base-eight representation of an
integer.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Replace the specification with the base-ten representation of an
integer.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%x</span></samp>&rsquo;<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%X</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-integer-to-hexadecimal-274"></a>Replace the specification with the base-sixteen representation of an
integer.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%x</span></samp>&rsquo; uses lower case and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%X</span></samp>&rsquo; uses upper case.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%c</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Replace the specification with the character which is the value given.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Replace the specification with the exponential notation for a floating
point number.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Replace the specification with the decimal-point notation for a floating
point number.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Replace the specification with notation for a floating point number,
using either exponential notation or decimal-point notation, whichever
is shorter.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Replace the specification with a single &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This format
specification is unusual in that it does not use a value.  For example,
<code>(format "%% %d" 30)</code> returns <code>"% 30"</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>Any other format character results in an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Invalid format
operation</span></samp>&rsquo; error.

   <p>Here are several examples:

<pre class="example">     (format "The name of this buffer is %s." (buffer-name))
          &rArr; "The name of this buffer is strings.texi."
     
     (format "The buffer object prints as %s." (current-buffer))
          &rArr; "The buffer object prints as strings.texi."
     
     (format "The octal value of %d is %o,
              and the hex value is %x." 18 18 18)
          &rArr; "The octal value of 18 is 22,
              and the hex value is 12."
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-field-width-275"></a><a name="index-padding-276"></a>  A specification can have a <dfn>width</dfn>, which is a decimal number
between the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; and the specification character.  If the printed
representation of the object contains fewer characters than this
width, <code>format</code> extends it with padding.  The width specifier is
ignored for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>&rsquo; specification.  Any padding introduced by
the width specifier normally consists of spaces inserted on the left:

<pre class="example">     (format "%5d is padded on the left with spaces" 123)
          &rArr; "  123 is padded on the left with spaces"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the width is too small, <code>format</code> does not truncate the
object's printed representation.  Thus, you can use a width to specify
a minimum spacing between columns with no risk of losing information. 
In the following three examples, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%7s</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies a minimum width
of 7.  In the first case, the string inserted in place of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%7s</span></samp>&rsquo;
has only 3 letters, and needs 4 blank spaces as padding.  In the
second case, the string <code>"specification"</code> is 13 letters wide but
is not truncated.

<pre class="example">     (format "The word `%7s' has %d letters in it."
             "foo" (length "foo"))
          &rArr; "The word `    foo' has 3 letters in it."
     (format "The word `%7s' has %d letters in it."
             "specification" (length "specification"))
          &rArr; "The word `specification' has 13 letters in it."
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-flags-in-format-specifications-277"></a>  Immediately after the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; and before the optional width
specifier, you can also put certain <dfn>flag characters</dfn>.

   <p>The flag &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; inserts a plus sign before a positive number, so
that it always has a sign.  A space character as flag inserts a space
before a positive number.  (Otherwise, positive numbers start with the
first digit.)  These flags are useful for ensuring that positive
numbers and negative numbers use the same number of columns.  They are
ignored except for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;, and if
both flags are used, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; takes precedence.

   <p>The flag &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies an &ldquo;alternate form&rdquo; which depends on
the format in use.  For &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>&rsquo;, it ensures that the result begins
with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%x</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%X</span></samp>&rsquo;, it prefixes the result
with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0X</span></samp>&rsquo;.  For &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;,
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; flag means include a decimal point even if the precision
is zero.

   <p>The flag &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; ensures that the padding consists of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;
characters instead of spaces.  This flag is ignored for non-numerical
specification characters like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%S</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%c</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
These specification characters accept the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; flag, but still pad
with <em>spaces</em>.

   <p>The flag &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; causes the padding inserted by the width
specifier, if any, to be inserted on the right rather than the left. 
If both &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; are present, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; flag is
ignored.

<pre class="example">     (format "%06d is padded on the left with zeros" 123)
          &rArr; "000123 is padded on the left with zeros"
     
     (format "%-6d is padded on the right" 123)
          &rArr; "123    is padded on the right"
     
     (format "The word `%-7s' actually has %d letters in it."
             "foo" (length "foo"))
          &rArr; "The word `foo    ' actually has 3 letters in it."
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-precision-in-format-specifications-278"></a>  All the specification characters allow an optional <dfn>precision</dfn>
before the character (after the width, if present).  The precision is
a decimal-point &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; followed by a digit-string.  For the
floating-point specifications (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>&rsquo;), the
precision specifies how many decimal places to show; if zero, the
decimal-point itself is also omitted.  For &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%S</span></samp>&rsquo;,
the precision truncates the string to the given width, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%.3s</span></samp>&rsquo;
shows only the first three characters of the representation for
<var>object</var>.  Precision has no effect for other specification
characters.
