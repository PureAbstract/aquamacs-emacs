<h4 class="subsection">21.2.1 Using <code>interactive</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-arguments_002c-interactive-entry-1299"></a>
  This section describes how to write the <code>interactive</code> form that
makes a Lisp function an interactively-callable command, and how to
examine a command's <code>interactive</code> form.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>interactive</b><var> arg-descriptor<a name="index-interactive-1300"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form declares that a function is a command, and that it
may therefore be called interactively (via <kbd>M-x</kbd> or by entering a
key sequence bound to it).  The argument <var>arg-descriptor</var> declares
how to compute the arguments to the command when the command is called
interactively.

        <p>A command may be called from Lisp programs like any other function, but
then the caller supplies the arguments and <var>arg-descriptor</var> has no
effect.

        <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binteractive_002dform_007d_002c-symbol-property-1301"></a>The <code>interactive</code> form must be located at top-level in the
function body, or in the function symbol's <code>interactive-form</code>
property (see <a href="Symbol-Properties.html#Symbol-Properties">Symbol Properties</a>).  It has its effect because the
command loop looks for it before calling the function
(see <a href="Interactive-Call.html#Interactive-Call">Interactive Call</a>).  Once the function is called, all its body
forms are executed; at this time, if the <code>interactive</code> form
occurs within the body, the form simply returns <code>nil</code> without
even evaluating its argument.

        <p>By convention, you should put the <code>interactive</code> form in the
function body, as the first top-level form.  If there is an
<code>interactive</code> form in both the <code>interactive-form</code> symbol
property and the function body, the former takes precedence.  The
<code>interactive-form</code> symbol property can be used to add an
interactive form to an existing function, or change how its arguments
are processed interactively, without redefining the function. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>There are three possibilities for the argument <var>arg-descriptor</var>:

     <ul>
<li>It may be omitted or <code>nil</code>; then the command is called with no
arguments.  This leads quickly to an error if the command requires one
or more arguments.

     <li>It may be a string; its contents are a sequence of elements separated
by newlines, one for each argument<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Each element consists of a code character
(see <a href="Interactive-Codes.html#Interactive-Codes">Interactive Codes</a>) optionally followed by a prompt (which
some code characters use and some ignore).  Here is an example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (interactive "P\nbFrobnicate buffer: ")
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">The code letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">P</span></samp>&rsquo; sets the command's first argument to the raw
command prefix (see <a href="Prefix-Command-Arguments.html#Prefix-Command-Arguments">Prefix Command Arguments</a>).  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bFrobnicate
buffer: </span></samp>&rsquo; prompts the user with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Frobnicate buffer: </span></samp>&rsquo; to enter
the name of an existing buffer, which becomes the second and final
argument.

     <p>The prompt string can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; to include previous argument values
(starting with the first argument) in the prompt.  This is done using
<code>format</code> (see <a href="Formatting-Strings.html#Formatting-Strings">Formatting Strings</a>).  For example, here is how
you could read the name of an existing buffer followed by a new name to
give to that buffer:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (interactive "bBuffer to rename: \nsRename buffer %s to: ")
</pre>
     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002a_007d-in-_0040code_007binteractive_007d-1302"></a><a name="index-read_002donly-buffers-in-interactive-1303"></a>If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; appears at the beginning of the string, then an error is
signaled if the buffer is read-only.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0040_0040_007d-in-_0040code_007binteractive_007d-1304"></a>If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; appears at the beginning of the string, and if the key
sequence used to invoke the command includes any mouse events, then
the window associated with the first of those events is selected
before the command is run.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_005e_007d-in-_0040code_007binteractive_007d-1305"></a><a name="index-shift_002dselection_002c-and-_0040code_007binteractive_007d-spec-1306"></a>If &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; appears at the beginning of the string, and if the command
was invoked through <dfn>shift-translation</dfn>, set the mark and activate
the region temporarily, or extend an already active region, before the
command is run.  If the command was invoked without shift-translation,
and the region is temporarily active, deactivate the region before the
command is run.  Shift-translation is controlled on the user level by
<code>shift-select-mode</code>; see <a href="../emacs/Shift-Selection.html#Shift-Selection">Shift Selection</a>.

     <p>You can use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;, and <code>^</code> together; the order does
not matter.  Actual reading of arguments is controlled by the rest of
the prompt string (starting with the first character that is not
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;).

     <li>It may be a Lisp expression that is not a string; then it should be a
form that is evaluated to get a list of arguments to pass to the
command.  Usually this form will call various functions to read input
from the user, most often through the minibuffer (see <a href="Minibuffers.html#Minibuffers">Minibuffers</a>)
or directly from the keyboard (see <a href="Reading-Input.html#Reading-Input">Reading Input</a>).

     <p>Providing point or the mark as an argument value is also common, but
if you do this <em>and</em> read input (whether using the minibuffer or
not), be sure to get the integer values of point or the mark after
reading.  The current buffer may be receiving subprocess output; if
subprocess output arrives while the command is waiting for input, it
could relocate point and the mark.

     <p>Here's an example of what <em>not</em> to do:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (interactive
           (list (region-beginning) (region-end)
                 (read-string "Foo: " nil 'my-history)))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Here's how to avoid the problem, by examining point and the mark after
reading the keyboard input:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (interactive
           (let ((string (read-string "Foo: " nil 'my-history)))
             (list (region-beginning) (region-end) string)))
</pre>
     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the argument values should not include any data
types that can't be printed and then read.  Some facilities save
<code>command-history</code> in a file to be read in the subsequent
sessions; if a command's arguments contain a data type that prints
using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#&lt;...&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; syntax, those facilities won't work.

     <p>There are, however, a few exceptions: it is ok to use a limited set of
expressions such as <code>(point)</code>, <code>(mark)</code>,
<code>(region-beginning)</code>, and <code>(region-end)</code>, because Emacs
recognizes them specially and puts the expression (rather than its
value) into the command history.  To see whether the expression you
wrote is one of these exceptions, run the command, then examine
<code>(car command-history)</code>.
