<h3 class="section">28.5 Cyclic Ordering of Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-cyclic-ordering-of-windows-2086"></a><a name="index-ordering-of-windows_002c-cyclic-2087"></a><a name="index-window-ordering_002c-cyclic-2088"></a>
  When you use the command <kbd>C-x o</kbd> (<code>other-window</code>) to select
some other window, it moves through the windows on the screen in a
specific order.  For any given configuration of windows, this order
never varies.  It is called the <dfn>cyclic ordering of windows</dfn>.

   <p>For a particular frame, this ordering generally goes from top to
bottom, and from left to right.  But it may go down first or go right
first, depending on the order in which windows were split.

   <p>If the first split was vertical (into windows one above each other),
and then the subwindows were split horizontally, then the ordering is
left to right in the top of the frame, and then left to right in the
next lower part of the frame, and so on.  If the first split was
horizontal, the ordering is top to bottom in the left part, and so on. 
In general, within each set of siblings at any level in the window tree
(see <a href="Window-Tree.html#Window-Tree">Window Tree</a>), the order is left to right, or top to bottom.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>next-window</b><var> &amp;optional window minibuf all-frames<a name="index-next_002dwindow-2089"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-minibuffer-window_002c-and-_0040code_007bnext_002dwindow_007d-2090"></a>This function returns the window following <var>window</var> in the cyclic
ordering of windows.  This is the window <kbd>C-x o</kbd> selects if typed
when <var>window</var> is selected.  The default for <var>window</var> is the
selected window.

        <p>The value of the optional argument <var>minibuf</var> specifies whether the
minibuffer is included in the window order.  Normally, when
<var>minibuf</var> is <code>nil</code>, the minibuffer is included only if it is
currently &ldquo;active&rdquo;; this matches the behavior of <kbd>C-x o</kbd>.  (The
minibuffer window is active while the minibuffer is in use; see
<a href="Minibuffers.html#Minibuffers">Minibuffers</a>.)

        <p>If <var>minibuf</var> is <code>t</code>, the cyclic ordering includes the
minibuffer window even if it is not active.  If <var>minibuf</var> is neither
<code>t</code> nor <code>nil</code>, the minibuffer window is not included even if
it is active.

        <p>The optional argument <var>all-frames</var> specifies which frames to
consider.  Here are the possible values and their meanings:

          <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Consider all the windows in <var>window</var>'s frame, plus the minibuffer
used by that frame even if it lies in some other frame.  If the
minibuffer counts (as determined by <var>minibuf</var>), then all windows on
all frames that share that minibuffer count too.

          <br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Consider all windows in all existing frames.

          <br><dt><code>visible</code><dd>Consider all windows in all visible frames.  (To get useful results, you
must ensure <var>window</var> is in a visible frame.)

          <br><dt>0<dd>Consider all windows in all visible or iconified frames.

          <br><dt>a frame<dd>Consider all windows on that frame.

          <br><dt>anything else<dd>Consider precisely the windows in <var>window</var>'s frame, and no others. 
</dl>

        <p>This example assumes there are two windows, both displaying the
buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">windows.texi</span></samp>&rsquo;:

     <pre class="example">          (selected-window)
               &rArr; #&lt;window 56 on windows.texi&gt;
          (next-window (selected-window))
               &rArr; #&lt;window 52 on windows.texi&gt;
          (next-window (next-window (selected-window)))
               &rArr; #&lt;window 56 on windows.texi&gt;
</pre>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>previous-window</b><var> &amp;optional window minibuf all-frames<a name="index-previous_002dwindow-2091"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the window preceding <var>window</var> in the cyclic
ordering of windows.  The other arguments specify which windows to
include in the cycle, as in <code>next-window</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>other-window</b><var> count &amp;optional all-frames<a name="index-other_002dwindow-2092"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function selects another window in the cyclic ordering of windows. 
<var>count</var> specifies the number of windows to skip in the ordering,
starting with the selected window, before making the selection.  If
<var>count</var> is a positive number, it skips <var>count</var> windows forwards. 
<var>count</var> negative means skip &minus;<var>count</var> windows backwards. 
If <var>count</var> is zero, it does not skip any window, thus re-selecting
the selected window.  In an interactive call, <var>count</var> is the numeric
prefix argument.

        <p>The optional argument <var>all-frames</var> has the same meaning as in
<code>next-window</code>, but the <var>minibuf</var> argument of <code>next-window</code>
is always effectively <code>nil</code>.  This function returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>walk-windows</b><var> proc &amp;optional minibuf all-frames<a name="index-walk_002dwindows-2093"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function cycles through all windows.  It calls the function
<code>proc</code> once for each window, with the window as its sole
argument.

        <p>The optional arguments <var>minibuf</var> and <var>all-frames</var> specify the
set of windows to include in the walk.  See <code>next-window</code>, above,
for details. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-list</b><var> &amp;optional frame minibuf window<a name="index-window_002dlist-2094"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a list of all windows on <var>frame</var>, starting
with <var>window</var>.  The default for <var>frame</var> is the selected frame;
the default for <var>window</var> is the selected window.

        <p>The value of <var>minibuf</var> specifies if the minibuffer window shall be
included in the result list.  If <var>minibuf</var> is <code>t</code>, the result
always includes the minibuffer window.  If <var>minibuf</var> is <code>nil</code>
or omitted, that includes the minibuffer window if it is active.  If
<var>minibuf</var> is neither <code>nil</code> nor <code>t</code>, the result never
includes the minibuffer window.
