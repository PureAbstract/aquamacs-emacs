<h3 class="section">28.9 Cyclic Ordering of Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-cyclic-ordering-of-windows-2319"></a><a name="index-ordering-of-windows_002c-cyclic-2320"></a><a name="index-window-ordering_002c-cyclic-2321"></a>
  When you use the command <kbd>C-x o</kbd> (<code>other-window</code>) to select
some other window, it moves through live windows in a specific order. 
For any given configuration of windows, this order never varies.  It
is called the <dfn>cyclic ordering of windows</dfn>.

   <p>The ordering is determined by a depth-first traversal of the frame's
window tree, retrieving the live windows which are the leaf nodes of
the tree (see <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>).  If the minibuffer is active,
the minibuffer window is included too.  The ordering is cyclic, so the
last window in the sequence is followed by the first one.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>next-window</b><var> &amp;optional window minibuf all-frames<a name="index-next_002dwindow-2322"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-minibuffer-window_002c-and-_0040code_007bnext_002dwindow_007d-2323"></a>This function returns a live window, the one following <var>window</var> in
the cyclic ordering of windows.  <var>window</var> should be a live window;
if omitted or <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected window.

        <p>The optional argument <var>minibuf</var> specifies whether minibuffer windows
should be included in the cyclic ordering.  Normally, when <var>minibuf</var>
is <code>nil</code>, a minibuffer window is included only if it is currently
&ldquo;active&rdquo;; this matches the behavior of <kbd>C-x o</kbd>.  (Note that a
minibuffer window is active as long as its minibuffer is in use; see
<a href="Minibuffers.html#Minibuffers">Minibuffers</a>).

        <p>If <var>minibuf</var> is <code>t</code>, the cyclic ordering includes all
minibuffer windows.  If <var>minibuf</var> is neither <code>t</code> nor
<code>nil</code>, minibuffer windows are not included even if they are active.

        <p>The optional argument <var>all-frames</var> specifies which frames to
consider:

          <ul>
<li><code>nil</code>
means to consider windows on <var>window</var>'s frame.  If the minibuffer
window is considered (as specified by the <var>minibuf</var> argument),
then frames that share the minibuffer window are considered too.

          <li><code>t</code>
means to consider windows on all existing frames.

          <li><code>visible</code>
means to consider windows on all visible frames.

          <li>0
means to consider windows on all visible or iconified frames.

          <li>A frame
means to consider windows on that specific frame.

          <li>Anything else
means to consider windows on <var>window</var>'s frame, and no others. 
</ul>

        <p>If more than one frame is considered, the cyclic ordering is obtained
by appending the orderings for those frames, in the same order as the
list of all live frames (see <a href="Finding-All-Frames.html#Finding-All-Frames">Finding All Frames</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>previous-window</b><var> &amp;optional window minibuf all-frames<a name="index-previous_002dwindow-2324"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a live window, the one preceding <var>window</var> in
the cyclic ordering of windows.  The other arguments are handled like
in <code>next-window</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>other-window</b><var> count &amp;optional all-frames<a name="index-other_002dwindow-2325"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function selects a live window, one <var>count</var> places from the
selected window in the cyclic ordering of windows.  If <var>count</var> is
a positive number, it skips <var>count</var> windows forwards; if
<var>count</var> is negative, it skips &minus;<var>count</var> windows
backwards; if <var>count</var> is zero, that simply re-selects the selected
window.  When called interactively, <var>count</var> is the numeric prefix
argument.

        <p>The optional argument <var>all-frames</var> has the same meaning as in
<code>next-window</code>, like a <code>nil</code> <var>minibuf</var> argument to
<code>next-window</code>.

        <p>This function does not select a window that has a non-<code>nil</code>
<code>no-other-window</code> window parameter (see <a href="Window-Parameters.html#Window-Parameters">Window Parameters</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>walk-windows</b><var> fun &amp;optional minibuf all-frames<a name="index-walk_002dwindows-2326"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function calls the function <var>fun</var> once for each live window,
with the window as the argument.

        <p>It follows the cyclic ordering of windows.  The optional arguments
<var>minibuf</var> and <var>all-frames</var> specify the set of windows
included; these have the same arguments as in <code>next-window</code>.  If
<var>all-frames</var> specifies a frame, the first window walked is the
first window on that frame (the one returned by
<code>frame-first-window</code>), not necessarily the selected window.

        <p>If <var>fun</var> changes the window configuration by splitting or deleting
windows, that does not alter the set of windows walked, which is
determined prior to calling <var>fun</var> for the first time. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>one-window-p</b><var> &amp;optional no-mini all-frames<a name="index-one_002dwindow_002dp-2327"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if the selected window is the only live
window, and <code>nil</code> otherwise.

        <p>If the minibuffer window is active, it is normally considered (so that
this function returns <code>nil</code>).  However, if the optional argument
<var>no-mini</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the minibuffer window is ignored even
if active.  The optional argument <var>all-frames</var> has the same
meaning as for <code>next-window</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-finding-windows-2328"></a>  The following functions return a window which satisfies some
criterion, without selecting it:

&mdash; Function: <b>get-lru-window</b><var> &amp;optional all-frames dedicated not-selected<a name="index-get_002dlru_002dwindow-2330"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a live window which is heuristically the &ldquo;least
recently used&rdquo; window.  The optional argument <var>all-frames</var> has
the same meaning as in <code>next-window</code>.

        <p>If any full-width windows are present, only those windows are
considered.  A minibuffer window is never a candidate.  A dedicated
window (see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>) is never a candidate unless the
optional argument <var>dedicated</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.  The selected
window is never returned, unless it is the only candidate.  However, if
the optional argument <var>not-selected</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this
function returns <code>nil</code> in that case. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-largest-window-2331"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>get-largest-window</b><var> &amp;optional all-frames dedicated not-selected<a name="index-get_002dlargest_002dwindow-2332"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the window with the largest area (height times
width).  The optional argument <var>all-frames</var> specifies the windows to
search, and has the same meaning as in <code>next-window</code>.

        <p>A minibuffer window is never a candidate.  A dedicated window
(see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>) is never a candidate unless the optional
argument <var>dedicated</var> is non-<code>nil</code>.  The selected window is not
a candidate if the optional argument <var>not-selected</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>.  If the optional argument <var>not-selected</var> is
non-<code>nil</code> and the selected window is the only candidate, this
function returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>If there are two candidate windows of the same size, this function
prefers the one that comes first in the cyclic ordering of windows,
starting from the selected window.

<blockquote><p>This function calls the function <var>predicate</var> for each of the
windows in the cyclic order of windows in turn, passing it the window
as an argument.  If the predicate returns non-<code>nil</code> for any
window, this function stops and returns that window.  If no such
window is found, the return value is <var>default</var> (which defaults to
<code>nil</code>).

        <p>The optional arguments <var>minibuf</var> and <var>all-frames</var> specify the
