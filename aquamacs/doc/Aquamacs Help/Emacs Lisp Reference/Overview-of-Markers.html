<h3 class="section">31.1 Overview of Markers</h3>

<p>A marker specifies a buffer and a position in that buffer.  A
marker can be used to represent a position in functions that
require one, just as an integer could be used.  In that case, the
marker's buffer is normally ignored.  Of course, a marker used in this
way usually points to a position in the buffer that the function
operates on, but that is entirely the programmer's responsibility. 
See <a href="Positions.html#Positions">Positions</a>, for a complete description of positions.

   <p>A marker has three attributes: the marker position, the marker
buffer, and the insertion type.  The marker position is an integer
that is equivalent (at a given time) to the marker as a position in
that buffer.  But the marker's position value can change during
the life of the marker, and often does.  Insertion and deletion of
text in the buffer relocate the marker.  The idea is that a marker
positioned between two characters remains between those two characters
despite insertion and deletion elsewhere in the buffer.  Relocation
changes the integer equivalent of the marker.

   <p><a name="index-marker-relocation-2793"></a>  Deleting text around a marker's position leaves the marker between the
characters immediately before and after the deleted text.  Inserting
text at the position of a marker normally leaves the marker either in
front of or after the new text, depending on the marker's <dfn>insertion
type</dfn> (see <a href="Marker-Insertion-Types.html#Marker-Insertion-Types">Marker Insertion Types</a>)&mdash;unless the insertion is done
with <code>insert-before-markers</code> (see <a href="Insertion.html#Insertion">Insertion</a>).

   <p><a name="index-marker-garbage-collection-2794"></a>  Insertion and deletion in a buffer must check all the markers and
relocate them if necessary.  This slows processing in a buffer with a
large number of markers.  For this reason, it is a good idea to make a
marker point nowhere if you are sure you don't need it any more. 
Markers that can no longer be accessed are eventually removed
(see <a href="Garbage-Collection.html#Garbage-Collection">Garbage Collection</a>).

   <p><a name="index-markers-as-numbers-2795"></a>  Because it is common to perform arithmetic operations on a marker
position, most of these operations (including <code>+</code> and
<code>-</code>) accept markers as arguments.  In such cases, the marker
stands for its current position.

   <p>Here are examples of creating markers, setting markers, and moving point
to markers:

<pre class="example">     ;; <span class="roman">Make a new marker that initially does not point anywhere:</span>
     (setq m1 (make-marker))
          &rArr; #&lt;marker in no buffer&gt;
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Set </span><code>m1</code><span class="roman"> to point between the 99th and 100th characters</span>
     ;;   <span class="roman">in the current buffer:</span>
     (set-marker m1 100)
          &rArr; #&lt;marker at 100 in markers.texi&gt;
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Now insert one character at the beginning of the buffer:</span>
     (goto-char (point-min))
          &rArr; 1
     (insert "Q")
          &rArr; nil
     
     ;; <code>m1</code><span class="roman"> is updated appropriately.</span>
     m1
          &rArr; #&lt;marker at 101 in markers.texi&gt;
     
     ;; <span class="roman">Two markers that point to the same position</span>
     ;;   <span class="roman">are not </span><code>eq</code><span class="roman">, but they are </span><code>equal</code><span class="roman">.</span>
     (setq m2 (copy-marker m1))
          &rArr; #&lt;marker at 101 in markers.texi&gt;
     (eq m1 m2)
          &rArr; nil
     (equal m1 m2)
          &rArr; t
     
     ;; <span class="roman">When you are finished using a marker, make it point nowhere.</span>
     (set-marker m1 nil)
          &rArr; #&lt;marker in no buffer&gt;
</pre>
