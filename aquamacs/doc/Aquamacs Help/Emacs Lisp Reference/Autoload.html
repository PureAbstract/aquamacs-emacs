<h3 class="section">15.5 Autoload</h3>

<p><a name="index-autoload-810"></a>
  The <dfn>autoload</dfn> facility allows you to make a function or macro
known in Lisp, but put off loading the file that defines it.  The first
call to the function automatically reads the proper file to install the
real definition and other associated code, then runs the real definition
as if it had been loaded all along.

   <p>There are two ways to set up an autoloaded function: by calling
<code>autoload</code>, and by writing a special &ldquo;magic&rdquo; comment in the
source before the real definition.  <code>autoload</code> is the low-level
primitive for autoloading; any Lisp program can call <code>autoload</code> at
any time.  Magic comments are the most convenient way to make a function
autoload, for packages installed along with Emacs.  These comments do
nothing on their own, but they serve as a guide for the command
<code>update-file-autoloads</code>, which constructs calls to <code>autoload</code>
and arranges to execute them when Emacs is built.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>autoload</b><var> function filename &amp;optional docstring interactive type<a name="index-autoload-811"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function defines the function (or macro) named <var>function</var> so as
to load automatically from <var>filename</var>.  The string <var>filename</var>
specifies the file to load to get the real definition of <var>function</var>.

        <p>If <var>filename</var> does not contain either a directory name, or the
suffix <code>.el</code> or <code>.elc</code>, then <code>autoload</code> insists on adding
one of these suffixes, and it will not load from a file whose name is
just <var>filename</var> with no added suffix.  (The variable
<code>load-suffixes</code> specifies the exact required suffixes.)

        <p>The argument <var>docstring</var> is the documentation string for the
function.  Specifying the documentation string in the call to
<code>autoload</code> makes it possible to look at the documentation without
loading the function's real definition.  Normally, this should be
identical to the documentation string in the function definition
itself.  If it isn't, the function definition's documentation string
takes effect when it is loaded.

        <p>If <var>interactive</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that says <var>function</var> can be
called interactively.  This lets completion in <kbd>M-x</kbd> work without
loading <var>function</var>'s real definition.  The complete interactive
specification is not given here; it's not needed unless the user
actually calls <var>function</var>, and when that happens, it's time to load
the real definition.

        <p>You can autoload macros and keymaps as well as ordinary functions. 
Specify <var>type</var> as <code>macro</code> if <var>function</var> is really a macro. 
Specify <var>type</var> as <code>keymap</code> if <var>function</var> is really a
keymap.  Various parts of Emacs need to know this information without
loading the real definition.

        <p>An autoloaded keymap loads automatically during key lookup when a prefix
key's binding is the symbol <var>function</var>.  Autoloading does not occur
for other kinds of access to the keymap.  In particular, it does not
happen when a Lisp program gets the keymap from the value of a variable
and calls <code>define-key</code>; not even if the variable name is the same
symbol <var>function</var>.

        <p><a name="index-function-cell-in-autoload-812"></a>If <var>function</var> already has a non-void function definition that is not
an autoload object, <code>autoload</code> does nothing and returns <code>nil</code>. 
If the function cell of <var>function</var> is void, or is already an autoload
object, then it is defined as an autoload object like this:

     <pre class="example">          (autoload <var>filename</var> <var>docstring</var> <var>interactive</var> <var>type</var>)
</pre>
        <p>For example,

     <pre class="example">          (symbol-function 'run-prolog)
               &rArr; (autoload "prolog" 169681 t nil)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">In this case, <code>"prolog"</code> is the name of the file to load, 169681
refers to the documentation string in the
<samp><span class="file">emacs/etc/DOC-</span><var>version</var></samp> file (see <a href="Documentation-Basics.html#Documentation-Basics">Documentation Basics</a>),
<code>t</code> means the function is interactive, and <code>nil</code> that it is
not a macro or a keymap. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-autoload-errors-813"></a>  The autoloaded file usually contains other definitions and may require
or provide one or more features.  If the file is not completely loaded
(due to an error in the evaluation of its contents), any function
definitions or <code>provide</code> calls that occurred during the load are
undone.  This is to ensure that the next attempt to call any function
autoloading from this file will try again to load the file.  If not for
this, then some of the functions in the file might be defined by the
aborted load, but fail to work properly for the lack of certain
subroutines not loaded successfully because they come later in the file.

   <p>If the autoloaded file fails to define the desired Lisp function or
macro, then an error is signaled with data <code>"Autoloading failed to
define function </code><var>function-name</var><code>"</code>.

   <p><a name="index-update_002dfile_002dautoloads-814"></a><a name="index-update_002ddirectory_002dautoloads-815"></a><a name="index-magic-autoload-comment-816"></a><a name="index-autoload-cookie-817"></a><a name="autoload-cookie"></a>A magic autoload comment (often called an <dfn>autoload cookie</dfn>)
consists of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;###autoload</span></samp>&rsquo;, on a line by itself,
just before the real definition of the function in its
autoloadable source file.  The command <kbd>M-x update-file-autoloads</kbd>
writes a corresponding <code>autoload</code> call into <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>. 
(The string that serves as the autoload cookie and the name of the
file generated by <code>update-file-autoloads</code> can be changed from the
above defaults, see below.) 
Building Emacs loads <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp> and thus calls <code>autoload</code>. 
<kbd>M-x update-directory-autoloads</kbd> is even more powerful; it updates
autoloads for all files in the current directory.

   <p>The same magic comment can copy any kind of form into
<samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>.  If the form following the magic comment is not a
function-defining form or a <code>defcustom</code> form, it is copied
verbatim.  &ldquo;Function-defining forms&rdquo; include <code>define-skeleton</code>,
<code>define-derived-mode</code>, <code>define-generic-mode</code> and
<code>define-minor-mode</code> as well as <code>defun</code> and
<code>defmacro</code>.  To save space, a <code>defcustom</code> form is converted to
a <code>defvar</code> in <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>, with some additional information
if it uses <code>:require</code>.

   <p>You can also use a magic comment to execute a form at build time
<em>without</em> executing it when the file itself is loaded.  To do this,
write the form <em>on the same line</em> as the magic comment.  Since it
is in a comment, it does nothing when you load the source file; but
<kbd>M-x update-file-autoloads</kbd> copies it to <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>, where
it is executed while building Emacs.

   <p>The following example shows how <code>doctor</code> is prepared for
autoloading with a magic comment:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;;###autoload
     (defun doctor ()
       "Switch to *doctor* buffer and start giving psychotherapy."
       (interactive)
       (switch-to-buffer "*doctor*")
       (doctor-mode))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here's what that produces in <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (autoload (quote doctor) "doctor" "\
     Switch to *doctor* buffer and start giving psychotherapy.
     
     \(fn)" t nil)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bfn_007d-in-function_0027s-documentation-string-818"></a>The backslash and newline immediately following the double-quote are a
convention used only in the preloaded uncompiled Lisp files such as
<samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>; they tell <code>make-docfile</code> to put the
documentation string in the <samp><span class="file">etc/DOC</span></samp> file.  See <a href="Building-Emacs.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a>. 
See also the commentary in <samp><span class="file">lib-src/make-docfile.c</span></samp>.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(fn)</span></samp>&rsquo;
in the usage part of the documentation string is replaced with the
function's name when the various help functions (see <a href="Help-Functions.html#Help-Functions">Help Functions</a>) display it.

   <p>If you write a function definition with an unusual macro that is not
one of the known and recognized function definition methods, use of an
ordinary magic autoload comment would copy the whole definition into
<code>loaddefs.el</code>.  That is not desirable.  You can put the desired
<code>autoload</code> call into <code>loaddefs.el</code> instead by writing this:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;;;###autoload (autoload 'foo "myfile")
     (mydefunmacro foo
       ...)
</pre>
   <p>You can use a non-default string as the autoload cookie and have the
corresponding autoload calls written into a file whose name is
different from the default <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>.  Emacs provides two
variables to control this:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>generate-autoload-cookie</b><var><a name="index-generate_002dautoload_002dcookie-819"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable should be a string whose syntax is a Lisp
comment.  <kbd>M-x update-file-autoloads</kbd> copies the Lisp form that
follows the cookie into the autoload file it generates.  The default
value of this variable is <code>";;;###autoload"</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>generated-autoload-file</b><var><a name="index-generated_002dautoload_002dfile-820"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable names an Emacs Lisp file where the autoload
calls should go.  The default value is <samp><span class="file">loaddefs.el</span></samp>, but you can
override that, e.g., in the &ldquo;Local Variables&rdquo; section of a
<samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file (see <a href="File-Local-Variables.html#File-Local-Variables">File Local Variables</a>).  The autoload file is
assumed to contain a trailer starting with a formfeed character. 
</p></blockquote></div>
