<h4 class="subsection">25.6.4 Other Information about Files</h4>

<p>This section describes the functions for getting detailed
information about a file, other than its contents.  This information
includes the mode bits that control access permissions, the owner and
group numbers, the number of names, the inode number, the size, and
the times of access and modification.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-modes</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dmodes-1950"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-file-permissions-1951"></a><a name="index-permissions_002c-file-1952"></a><a name="index-file-attributes-1953"></a><a name="index-file-modes-1954"></a>This function returns the <dfn>mode bits</dfn> describing the <dfn>file
permissions</dfn> of <var>filename</var>, as an integer.  It recursively follows
symbolic links in <var>filename</var> at all levels.  If <var>filename</var>
does not exist, the return value is <code>nil</code>.

        <p>See <a href="../coreutils/File-permissions.html#File-permissions">File permissions</a>, for a description of mode bits.  If the low-order bit is 1,
then the file is executable by all users, if the second-lowest-order
bit is 1, then the file is writable by all users, etc.  The highest
value returnable is 4095 (7777 octal), meaning that everyone has read,
write, and execute permission, that the <acronym>SUID</acronym> bit is set for
both others and group, and that the sticky bit is set.

     <pre class="example">          (file-modes "~/junk/diffs")
               &rArr; 492               ; <span class="roman">Decimal integer.</span>
          (format "%o" 492)
               &rArr; "754"             ; <span class="roman">Convert to octal.</span>
          
          (set-file-modes "~/junk/diffs" #o666)
               &rArr; nil
          
          $ ls -l diffs
          -rw-rw-rw- 1 lewis lewis 3063 Oct 30 16:00 diffs
</pre>
        <p>See <a href="Changing-Files.html#Changing-Files">Changing Files</a>, for functions that change file permissions,
such as <code>set-file-modes</code>.

        <p><a name="index-MS_002dDOS-and-file-modes-1955"></a><a name="index-file-modes-and-MS_002dDOS-1956"></a><strong>MS-DOS note:</strong> On MS-DOS, there is no such thing as an
&ldquo;executable&rdquo; file mode bit.  So <code>file-modes</code> considers a file
executable if its name ends in one of the standard executable
extensions, such as <samp><span class="file">.com</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.bat</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.exe</span></samp>, and some
others.  Files that begin with the Unix-standard &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>&rsquo; signature,
such as shell and Perl scripts, are also considered executable. 
Directories are also reported as executable, for compatibility with
Unix.  These conventions are also followed by <code>file-attributes</code>,
below. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If the <var>filename</var> argument to the next two functions is a
symbolic link, then these function do <em>not</em> replace it with its
target.  However, they both recursively follow symbolic links at all
levels of parent directories.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-nlinks</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dnlinks-1957"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the number of names (i.e., hard links) that
file <var>filename</var> has.  If the file does not exist, this function
returns <code>nil</code>.  Note that symbolic links have no effect on this
function, because they are not considered to be names of the files
they link to.

     <pre class="example">          $ ls -l foo*
          -rw-rw-rw- 2 rms rms 4 Aug 19 01:27 foo
          -rw-rw-rw- 2 rms rms 4 Aug 19 01:27 foo1
          
          (file-nlinks "foo")
               &rArr; 2
          (file-nlinks "doesnt-exist")
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-attributes</b><var> filename &amp;optional id-format<a name="index-file_002dattributes-1958"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-file_002dattributes"></a>This function returns a list of attributes of file <var>filename</var>.  If
the specified file cannot be opened, it returns <code>nil</code>. 
The optional parameter <var>id-format</var> specifies the preferred format
of attributes <acronym>UID</acronym> and <acronym>GID</acronym> (see below)&mdash;the
valid values are <code>'string</code> and <code>'integer</code>.  The latter is
the default, but we plan to change that, so you should specify a
non-<code>nil</code> value for <var>id-format</var> if you use the returned
<acronym>UID</acronym> or <acronym>GID</acronym>.

        <p>The elements of the list, in order, are:

          <ol type=1 start=0>
<li><code>t</code> for a directory, a string for a symbolic link (the name
linked to), or <code>nil</code> for a text file.

          <!-- Wordy so as to prevent an overfull hbox.  -rjc 15mar92 -->
          <li>The number of names the file has.  Alternate names, also known as hard
links, can be created by using the <code>add-name-to-file</code> function
(see <a href="Changing-Files.html#Changing-Files">Changing Files</a>).

          <li>The file's <acronym>UID</acronym>, normally as a string.  However, if it does
not correspond to a named user, the value is an integer or a floating
point number.

          <li>The file's <acronym>GID</acronym>, likewise.

          <li>The time of last access, as a list of four integers <code>(</code><var>sec-high</var>
<var>sec-low</var> <var>microsec</var> <var>picosec</var><code>)</code>.  (This is similar to the
value of <code>current-time</code>; see <a href="Time-of-Day.html#Time-of-Day">Time of Day</a>.)  Note that on
some FAT-based filesystems, only the date of last access is recorded,
so this time will always hold the midnight of the day of last access.

          <p><a name="index-modification-time-of-file-1959"></a><li>The time of last modification as a list of four integers (as above). 
This is the last time when the file's contents were modified.

          <li>The time of last status change as a list of four integers (as above). 
This is the time of the last change to the file's access mode bits,
its owner and group, and other information recorded in the filesystem
for the file, beyond the file's contents.

          <li>The size of the file in bytes.  If the size is too large to fit in a
Lisp integer, this is a floating point number.

          <li>The file's modes, as a string of ten letters or dashes,
as in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ls -l</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <li>An unspecified value, present for backward compatibility.

          <li>The file's inode number.  If possible, this is an integer.  If the
inode number is too large to be represented as an integer in Emacs
Lisp but dividing it by 2^16 yields a representable integer,
then the value has the
form <code>(</code><var>high</var><code> . </code><var>low</var><code>)</code>, where <var>low</var> holds the low 16
bits.  If the inode number is too wide for even that, the value is of the form
<code>(</code><var>high</var> <var>middle</var><code> . </code><var>low</var><code>)</code>, where <code>high</code> holds
the high bits, <var>middle</var> the middle 24 bits, and <var>low</var> the low
16 bits.

          <li>The filesystem number of the device that the file is on.  Depending on
the magnitude of the value, this can be either an integer or a cons
cell, in the same manner as the inode number.  This element and the
file's inode number together give enough information to distinguish
any two files on the system&mdash;no two files can have the same values
for both of these numbers.
             </ol>

        <p>For example, here are the file attributes for <samp><span class="file">files.texi</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          (file-attributes "files.texi" 'string)
               &rArr;  (nil 1 "lh" "users"
                    (20614 64019 50040 152000)
                    (20000 23 0 0)
                    (20614 64555 902289 872000)
                    122295 "-rw-rw-rw-"
                    t (5888 2 . 43978)
                    (15479 . 46724))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">and here is how the result is interpreted:

          <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>is neither a directory nor a symbolic link.

          <br><dt><code>1</code><dd>has only one name (the name <samp><span class="file">files.texi</span></samp> in the current default
directory).

          <br><dt><code>"lh"</code><dd>is owned by the user with name "lh".

          <br><dt><code>"users"</code><dd>is in the group with name "users".

          <br><dt><code>(20614 64019 50040 152000)</code><dd>was last accessed on October 23, 2012, at 20:12:03.050040152 UTC.

          <br><dt><code>(20000 23 0 0)</code><dd>was last modified on July 15, 2001, at 08:53:43 UTC.

          <br><dt><code>(20614 64555 902289 872000)</code><dd>last had its status changed on October 23, 2012, at 20:20:59.902289872 UTC.

          <br><dt><code>122295</code><dd>is 122295 bytes long.  (It may not contain 122295 characters, though,
if some of the bytes belong to multibyte sequences, and also if the
end-of-line format is CR-LF.)

          <br><dt><code>"-rw-rw-rw-"</code><dd>has a mode of read and write access for the owner, group, and world.

          <br><dt><code>t</code><dd>is merely a placeholder; it carries no information.

          <br><dt><code>(5888 2 . 43978)</code><dd>has an inode number of 6473924464520138.

          <br><dt><code>(15479 . 46724)</code><dd>is on the file-system device whose number is 1014478468.

   <p><a name="index-SELinux-context-1960"></a>  SELinux is a Linux kernel feature which provides more sophisticated
file access controls than ordinary &ldquo;Unix-style&rdquo; file permissions. 
If Emacs has been compiled with SELinux support on a system with
SELinux enabled, you can use the function <code>file-selinux-context</code>
to retrieve a file's SELinux security context.  For the function
<code>set-file-selinux-context</code>, see <a href="Changing-Files.html#Changing-Files">Changing Files</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-selinux-context</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dselinux_002dcontext-1961"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the SELinux security context of the file
<var>filename</var>.  This return value is a list of the form
<code>(</code><var>user</var> <var>role</var> <var>type</var> <var>range</var><code>)</code>, whose elements
are the context's user, role, type, and range respectively, as Lisp
strings.  See the SELinux documentation for details about what these
actually mean.

        <p>If the file does not exist or is inaccessible, or if the system does
not support SELinux, or if Emacs was not compiled with SELinux
support, then the return value is <code>(nil nil nil nil)</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-access-control-list-1962"></a><a name="index-ACL-entries-1963"></a>  If Emacs has been compiled with <dfn>ACL</dfn> (access control list)
support, you can use the function <code>file-acl</code> to retrieve a file's
ACL entries.  The interface implementation is platform-specific; on
GNU/Linux and BSD, Emacs uses the POSIX ACL interface, while on
MS-Windows Emacs emulates the POSIX ACL interface with native file
security APIs.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-acl</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dacl-1964"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the ACL entries of the file <var>filename</var>.  The
return value is a platform-dependent object containing some
representation of the ACL entries.  Don't use it for anything except
passing it to the <code>set-file-acl</code> function (see <a href="Changing-Files.html#Changing-Files">set-file-acl</a>).

        <p>If the file does not exist or is inaccessible, or if Emacs was unable to
determine the ACL entries, then the return value is <code>nil</code>.  The
latter can happen for local files if Emacs was not compiled with ACL
support, or for remote files if the file handler returns nil for the
file's ACL entries.
