<p><a name="index-selecting-a-window-2312"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>select-window</b><var> window &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-select_002dwindow-2313"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the selected window and the window
selected within its frame (see <a href="Basic-Windows.html#Basic-Windows">Basic Windows</a>) and selects that
frame.  <var>window</var> must be a live window.  This function also makes
<var>window</var>'s buffer (see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>) current and sets
that buffer's value of <code>point</code> to the value of <code>window-point</code>
(see <a href="Window-Point.html#Window-Point">Window Point</a>) in <var>window</var>.  The return value is
<var>window</var>.

        <p>By default, this function also moves <var>window</var>'s buffer to the front
of the buffer list (see <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>), and makes <var>window</var> the
most recently selected window.  However, if the optional argument
<var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, these additional actions are omitted. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-most-recently-selected-windows-2314"></a>  The sequence of calls to <code>select-window</code> with a non-<code>nil</code>
<var>norecord</var> argument determines an ordering of windows by their
selection time.  The function <code>get-lru-window</code> can be used to
retrieve the least recently selected live window (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>save-selected-window</b><var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-save_002dselected_002dwindow-2315"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro records the selected frame, as well as the selected window
of each frame, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then restores the
earlier selected frame and windows.  It also saves and restores the
current buffer.  It returns the value of the last form in <var>forms</var>.

        <p>This macro does not save or restore anything about the sizes,
arrangement or contents of windows; therefore, if <var>forms</var> change
them, the change persists.  If the previously selected window of some
frame is no longer live at the time of exit from <var>forms</var>, that
frame's selected window is left alone.  If the previously selected
window is no longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of
<var>forms</var> remains selected.  The current buffer is restored if and
only if it is still live when exiting <var>forms</var>.

        <p>This macro changes neither the ordering of recently selected windows nor
the buffer list. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>with-selected-window</b><var> window forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dselected_002dwindow-2316"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro selects <var>window</var>, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then
restores the previously selected window and current buffer.  The ordering
of recently selected windows and the buffer list remain unchanged unless
you deliberately change them within <var>forms</var>; for example, by calling
<code>select-window</code> with argument <var>norecord</var> <code>nil</code>.

        <p>This macro does not change the order of recently selected windows or
the buffer list. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>frame-selected-window</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-frame_002dselected_002dwindow-2317"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the window on <var>frame</var> that is selected
within that frame.  <var>frame</var> should be a live frame; if omitted or
<code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected frame. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-frame-selected-window</b><var> frame window &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-set_002dframe_002dselected_002dwindow-2318"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the window selected within the frame
<var>frame</var>.  <var>frame</var> should be a live frame; if <code>nil</code>, it
defaults to the selected frame.  <var>window</var> should be a live window;
if <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected window.

        <p>If <var>frame</var> is the selected frame, this makes <var>window</var> the
selected window.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this
function does not alter the list of most recently selected windows,
nor the buffer list.
