<h3 class="section">28.1 Basic Concepts of Emacs Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-2210"></a>
A <dfn>window</dfn> is an area of the screen that is used to display a buffer
(see <a href="Buffers.html#Buffers">Buffers</a>).  In Emacs Lisp, windows are represented by a special
Lisp object type.

   <p><a name="index-multiple-windows-2211"></a>  Windows are grouped into frames (see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>).  Each frame
contains at least one window; the user can subdivide it into multiple,
non-overlapping windows to view several buffers at once.  Lisp
programs can use multiple windows for a variety of purposes.  In
Rmail, for example, you can view a summary of message titles in one
window, and the contents of the selected message in another window.

   <p><a name="index-terminal-screen-2212"></a><a name="index-screen-of-terminal-2213"></a>  Emacs uses the word &ldquo;window&rdquo; with a different meaning than in
graphical desktop environments and window systems, such as the X
Window System.  When Emacs is run on X, each of its graphical X
windows is an Emacs frame (containing one or more Emacs windows). 
When Emacs is run on a text terminal, the frame fills the entire
terminal screen.

   <p><a name="index-tiled-windows-2214"></a>  Unlike X windows, Emacs windows are <dfn>tiled</dfn>; they never overlap
within the area of the frame.  When a window is created, resized, or
deleted, the change in window space is taken from or given to the
adjacent windows, so that the total area of the frame is unchanged.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>windowp</b><var> object<a name="index-windowp-2215"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a window (whether or
not it displays a buffer).  Otherwise, it returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-live-windows-2216"></a>A <dfn>live window</dfn> is one that is actually displaying a buffer in a
frame.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-live-p</b><var> object<a name="index-window_002dlive_002dp-2217"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a live window and
<code>nil</code> otherwise.  A live window is one that displays a buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-internal-windows-2218"></a>The windows in each frame are organized into a <dfn>window tree</dfn>. 
See <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>.  The leaf nodes of each window tree are live
windows&mdash;the ones actually displaying buffers.  The internal nodes of
the window tree are <dfn>internal windows</dfn>, which are not live.

   <p><a name="index-valid-windows-2219"></a>   A <dfn>valid window</dfn> is one that is either live or internal.  A valid
window can be <dfn>deleted</dfn>, i.e., removed from its frame
(see <a href="Deleting-Windows.html#Deleting-Windows">Deleting Windows</a>); then it is no longer valid, but the Lisp
object representing it might be still referenced from other Lisp
objects.  A deleted window may be made valid again by restoring a saved
window configuration (see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>).

   <p>You can distinguish valid windows from deleted windows with
<code>window-valid-p</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-valid-p</b><var> object<a name="index-window_002dvalid_002dp-2220"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a live window, or an
internal window in a window tree.  Otherwise, it returns <code>nil</code>,
including for the case where <var>object</var> is a deleted window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-selected-window-2221"></a><a name="index-window-selected-within-a-frame-2222"></a>  In each frame, at any time, exactly one Emacs window is designated
as <dfn>selected within the frame</dfn>.  For the selected frame, that
window is called the <dfn>selected window</dfn>&mdash;the one in which most
editing takes place, and in which the cursor for selected windows
appears (see <a href="Cursor-Parameters.html#Cursor-Parameters">Cursor Parameters</a>).  The selected window's buffer is
usually also the current buffer, except when <code>set-buffer</code> has
been used (see <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>).  As for non-selected frames, the
window selected within the frame becomes the selected window if the
frame is ever selected.  See <a href="Selecting-Windows.html#Selecting-Windows">Selecting Windows</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>selected-window</b><var><a name="index-selected_002dwindow-2223"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the selected window (which is always a live
window). 
</p></blockquote></div>
