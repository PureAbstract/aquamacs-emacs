<h3 class="section">34.4 Regular Expression Searching</h3>

<p><a name="index-regular-expression-searching-3366"></a><a name="index-regexp-searching-3367"></a><a name="index-searching-for-regexp-3368"></a>
  In GNU Emacs, you can search for the next match for a regular
expression either incrementally or not.  For incremental search
commands, see <a href="../emacs/Regexp-Search.html#Regexp-Search">Regular Expression Search</a>.  Here we describe only the search functions
useful in programs.  The principal one is <code>re-search-forward</code>.

   <p>These search functions convert the regular expression to multibyte if
the buffer is multibyte; they convert the regular expression to unibyte
if the buffer is unibyte.  See <a href="Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">Text Representations</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>re-search-forward</b><var> regexp &amp;optional limit noerror repeat<a name="index-re_002dsearch_002dforward-3369"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function searches forward in the current buffer for a string of
text that is matched by the regular expression <var>regexp</var>.  The
function skips over any amount of text that is not matched by
<var>regexp</var>, and leaves point at the end of the first match found. 
It returns the new value of point.

        <p>If <var>limit</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it must be a position in the current
buffer.  It specifies the upper bound to the search.  No match
extending after that position is accepted.

        <p>If <var>repeat</var> is supplied, it must be a positive number; the search
is repeated that many times; each repetition starts at the end of the
previous match.  If all these successive searches succeed, the search
succeeds, moving point and returning its new value.  Otherwise the
search fails.  What <code>re-search-forward</code> does when the search
fails depends on the value of <var>noerror</var>:

          <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Signal a <code>search-failed</code> error. 
<br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Do nothing and return <code>nil</code>. 
<br><dt>anything else<dd>Move point to <var>limit</var> (or the end of the accessible portion of the
buffer) and return <code>nil</code>. 
</dl>

        <p>In the following example, point is initially before the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Evaluating the search call moves point to the end of that line (between
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo; of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hat</span></samp>&rsquo; and the newline).

     <pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          I read "-!-The cat in the hat
          comes back" twice.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (re-search-forward "[a-z]+" nil t 5)
               &rArr; 27
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          I read "The cat in the hat-!-
          comes back" twice.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
</pre>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>re-search-backward</b><var> regexp &amp;optional limit noerror repeat<a name="index-re_002dsearch_002dbackward-3370"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function searches backward in the current buffer for a string of
text that is matched by the regular expression <var>regexp</var>, leaving
point at the beginning of the first text found.

        <p>This function is analogous to <code>re-search-forward</code>, but they are not
simple mirror images.  <code>re-search-forward</code> finds the match whose
beginning is as close as possible to the starting point.  If
<code>re-search-backward</code> were a perfect mirror image, it would find the
match whose end is as close as possible.  However, in fact it finds the
match whose beginning is as close as possible (and yet ends before the
starting point).  The reason for this is that matching a regular
expression at a given spot always works from beginning to end, and
starts at a specified beginning position.

        <p>A true mirror-image of <code>re-search-forward</code> would require a special
feature for matching regular expressions from end to beginning.  It's
not worth the trouble of implementing that.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>string-match</b><var> regexp string &amp;optional start<a name="index-string_002dmatch-3371"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the index of the start of the first match for
the regular expression <var>regexp</var> in <var>string</var>, or <code>nil</code> if
there is no match.  If <var>start</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the search starts
at that index in <var>string</var>.

        <p>For example,

     <pre class="example">          (string-match
           "quick" "The quick brown fox jumped quickly.")
               &rArr; 4
          (string-match
           "quick" "The quick brown fox jumped quickly." 8)
               &rArr; 27
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">The index of the first character of the
string is 0, the index of the second character is 1, and so on.

        <p>After this function returns, the index of the first character beyond
the match is available as <code>(match-end 0)</code>.  See <a href="Match-Data.html#Match-Data">Match Data</a>.

     <pre class="example">          (string-match
           "quick" "The quick brown fox jumped quickly." 8)
               &rArr; 27
          
          (match-end 0)
               &rArr; 32
</pre>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>string-match-p</b><var> regexp string &amp;optional start<a name="index-string_002dmatch_002dp-3372"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This predicate function does what <code>string-match</code> does, but it
avoids modifying the match data. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>looking-at</b><var> regexp<a name="index-looking_002dat-3373"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function determines whether the text in the current buffer directly
following point matches the regular expression <var>regexp</var>.  &ldquo;Directly
following&rdquo; means precisely that: the search is &ldquo;anchored&rdquo; and it can
succeed only starting with the first character following point.  The
result is <code>t</code> if so, <code>nil</code> otherwise.

        <p>This function does not move point, but it does update the match data. 
See <a href="Match-Data.html#Match-Data">Match Data</a>.  If you need to test for a match without modifying
the match data, use <code>looking-at-p</code>, described below.

        <p>In this example, point is located directly before the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If it
were anywhere else, the result would be <code>nil</code>.

     <pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          I read "-!-The cat in the hat
          comes back" twice.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (looking-at "The cat in the hat$")
               &rArr; t
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>looking-back</b><var> regexp &amp;optional limit greedy<a name="index-looking_002dback-3374"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>regexp</var> matches the text
immediately before point (i.e., ending at point), and <code>nil</code> otherwise.

        <p>Because regular expression matching works only going forward, this is
implemented by searching backwards from point for a match that ends at
point.  That can be quite slow if it has to search a long distance. 
You can bound the time required by specifying <var>limit</var>, which says
not to search before <var>limit</var>.  In this case, the match that is
found must begin at or after <var>limit</var>.  Here's an example:

     <pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          I read "-!-The cat in the hat
          comes back" twice.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (looking-back "read \"" 3)
               &rArr; t
          (looking-back "read \"" 4)
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
        <p>If <var>greedy</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function extends the match
backwards as far as possible, stopping when a single additional
previous character cannot be part of a match for regexp.  When the
match is extended, its starting position is allowed to occur before
<var>limit</var>.

     <!-- http://debbugs.gnu.org/5689 -->
        <p>As a general recommendation, try to avoid using <code>looking-back</code>
wherever possible, since it is slow.  For this reason, there are no
plans to add a <code>looking-back-p</code> function. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>looking-at-p</b><var> regexp<a name="index-looking_002dat_002dp-3375"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This predicate function works like <code>looking-at</code>, but without
updating the match data. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>search-spaces-regexp</b><var><a name="index-search_002dspaces_002dregexp-3376"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a regular expression
that says how to search for whitespace.  In that case, any group of
spaces in a regular expression being searched for stands for use of
this regular expression.  However, spaces inside of constructs such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; are not affected by
<code>search-spaces-regexp</code>.

        <p>Since this variable affects all regular expression search and match
constructs, you should bind it temporarily for as small as possible
a part of the code.
