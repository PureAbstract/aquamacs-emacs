<h3 class="section">16.6 Compiler Errors</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-errors-925"></a>
  Byte compilation outputs all errors and warnings into the buffer
<samp><span class="file">*Compile-Log*</span></samp>.  The messages include file names and line
numbers that identify the location of the problem.  The usual Emacs
commands for operating on compiler diagnostics work properly on these
messages.

   <p>When an error is due to invalid syntax in the program, the byte
compiler might get confused about the errors' exact location.  One way
to investigate is to switch to the buffer <samp><span class="file">&nbsp;*Compiler&nbsp;Input*</span></samp><!-- /@w -->. 
(This buffer name starts with a space, so it does not show up in
<kbd>M-x list-buffers</kbd>.)  This buffer contains the program being
compiled, and point shows how far the byte compiler was able to read;
the cause of the error might be nearby.  See <a href="Syntax-Errors.html#Syntax-Errors">Syntax Errors</a>, for
some tips for locating syntax errors.

   <p>When the byte compiler warns about functions that were used but not
defined, it always reports the line number for the end of the file,
not the locations where the missing functions were called.  To find
the latter, you must search for the function names.

   <p>You can suppress the compiler warning for calling an undefined
function <var>func</var> by conditionalizing the function call on an
<code>fboundp</code> test, like this:

<pre class="example">     (if (fboundp '<var>func</var>) ...(<var>func</var> ...)...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The call to <var>func</var> must be in the <var>then-form</var> of the
<code>if</code>, and <var>func</var> must appear quoted in the call to
<code>fboundp</code>.  (This feature operates for <code>cond</code> as well.)

   <p>You can tell the compiler that a function is defined using
<code>declare-function</code> (see <a href="Declaring-Functions.html#Declaring-Functions">Declaring Functions</a>).  Likewise, you
can tell the compiler that a variable is defined using <code>defvar</code>
with no initial value.

   <p>You can suppress the compiler warning for a specific use of an
undefined variable <var>variable</var> by conditionalizing its use on a
<code>boundp</code> test, like this:

<pre class="example">     (if (boundp '<var>variable</var>) ...<var>variable</var>...)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The reference to <var>variable</var> must be in the <var>then-form</var> of the
<code>if</code>, and <var>variable</var> must appear quoted in the call to
<code>boundp</code>.

   <p>You can suppress any and all compiler warnings within a certain
expression using the construct <code>with-no-warnings</code>:

<!-- This is implemented with a defun, but conceptually it is -->
<!-- a special form. -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>with-no-warnings</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dno_002dwarnings-926"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>In execution, this is equivalent to <code>(progn </code><var>body</var><code>...)</code>,
but the compiler does not issue warnings for anything that occurs
inside <var>body</var>.

        <p>We recommend that you use this construct around the smallest
possible piece of code, to avoid missing possible warnings other than
one you intend to suppress. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>More precise control of warnings is possible by setting the variable
<code>byte-compile-warnings</code>.
