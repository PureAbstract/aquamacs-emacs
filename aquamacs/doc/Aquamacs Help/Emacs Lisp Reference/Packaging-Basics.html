  A package is either a <dfn>simple package</dfn> or a <dfn>multi-file
package</dfn>.  A simple package is stored in a package archive as a single
Emacs Lisp file, while a multi-file package is stored as a tar file
(containing multiple Lisp files, and possibly non-Lisp files such as a
manual).

   <p>In ordinary usage, the difference between simple packages and
multi-file packages is relatively unimportant; the Package Menu
interface makes no distinction between them.  However, the procedure
for creating them differs, as explained in the following sections.

   <p>Each package (whether simple or multi-file) has certain
<dfn>attributes</dfn>:

     <dl>
<dt>Name<dd>A short word (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">auctex</span></samp>&rsquo;).  This is usually also the symbol
prefix used in the program (see <a href="Coding-Conventions.html#Coding-Conventions">Coding Conventions</a>).

     <br><dt>Version<dd>A version number, in a form that the function <code>version-to-list</code>
understands (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">11.86</span></samp>&rsquo;).  Each release of a package should be
accompanied by an increase in the version number.

     <br><dt>Brief description<dd>This is shown when the package is listed in the Package Menu.  It
should occupy a single line, ideally in 36 characters or less.

     <br><dt>Long description<dd>This is shown in the buffer created by <kbd>C-h P</kbd>
(<code>describe-package</code>), following the package's brief description
and installation status.  It normally spans multiple lines, and should
fully describe the package's capabilities and how to begin using it
once it is installed.

     <br><dt>Dependencies<dd>A list of other packages (possibly including minimal acceptable
version numbers) on which this package depends.  The list may be
empty, meaning this package has no dependencies.  Otherwise,
installing this package also automatically installs its dependencies;
if any dependency cannot be found, the package cannot be installed. 
</dl>

   <p><a name="index-content-directory_002c-package-4272"></a>  Installing a package, either via the command <code>package-install-file</code>,
or via the Package Menu, creates a subdirectory of
<code>package-user-dir</code> named <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-</span><var>version</var></samp>, where
<var>name</var> is the package's name and <var>version</var> its version
(e.g., <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs.d/elpa/auctex-11.86/</span></samp>).  We call this the
package's <dfn>content directory</dfn>.  It is where Emacs puts the
package's contents (the single Lisp file for a simple package, or the
files extracted from a multi-file package).

   <p><a name="index-package-autoloads-4273"></a>  Emacs then searches every Lisp file in the content directory for
autoload magic comments (see <a href="Autoload.html#Autoload">Autoload</a>).  These autoload
definitions are saved to a file named <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-autoloads.el</span></samp>
in the content directory.  They are typically used to autoload the
principal user commands defined in the package, but they can also
perform other tasks, such as adding an element to
<code>auto-mode-alist</code> (see <a href="Auto-Major-Mode.html#Auto-Major-Mode">Auto Major Mode</a>).  Note that a package
typically does <em>not</em> autoload every function and variable defined
within it&mdash;only the handful of commands typically called to begin
using the package.  Emacs then byte-compiles every Lisp file in the
package.

   <p>After installation, the installed package is <dfn>loaded</dfn>: Emacs
adds the package's content directory to <code>load-path</code>, and
evaluates the autoload definitions in <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">-autoloads.el</span></samp>.

   <p>Whenever Emacs starts up, it automatically calls the function
<code>package-initialize</code> to load installed packages.  This is done
after loading the init file and abbrev file (if any) and before
running <code>after-init-hook</code> (see <a href="Startup-Summary.html#Startup-Summary">Startup Summary</a>).  Automatic
package loading is disabled if the user option
<code>package-enable-at-startup</code> is <code>nil</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>package-initialize</b><var> &amp;optional no-activate<a name="index-package_002dinitialize-4274"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function initializes Emacs' internal record of which packages are
installed, and loads them.  The user option <code>package-load-list</code>
specifies which packages to load; by default, all installed packages
are loaded.  See <a href="../emacs/Package-Installation.html#Package-Installation">Package Installation</a>.

        <p>The optional argument <var>no-activate</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, causes
Emacs to update its record of installed packages without actually
loading them; it is for internal use only. 
</p></blockquote></div>
