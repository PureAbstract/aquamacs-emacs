<p><a name="index-packaging-basics-3911"></a>
  A package has a few attributes:
<a name="index-package-attributes-3912"></a>
     <dl>
<dt>Name<dd>A string, the name of the package.  This attribute is mandatory.  If
it does not exist, the package cannot be installed by the package
manager.

     <br><dt>Version<dd>A version number, which is anything that can be parsed by
<code>version-to-list</code>.  This attribute is mandatory.  If it does not
exist, the package cannot be installed by the package manager.

     <br><dt>Brief description<dd>This is shown to the user in the package menu buffer.  It is just a
single line.  On a terminal with 80 characters per line, there are
only 36 characters available in the package menu mode for showing the
brief description, so it is best to keep it very brief.  If no brief
name is given, an empty string is used.

     <br><dt>Long description<dd>This can be a <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file or the like.  This is available to
the user before the package is installed, via the package menu.  It
should more fully describe the package and its capabilities, so a user
can read it to decide whether he wants to install the package.  This
attribute is optional.

     <br><dt>Dependencies<dd>This is a list of other packages and their minimal acceptable
versions.  This is used both at download time (to make sure all the
needed code is available) and at activation time (to ensure a package
is only activated if all its dependencies have been successfully
activated).  This attribute is optional.

     <br><dt>Manual<dd>A package can optionally include an Info manual. 
</dl>

   <p>Conceptually, a package goes through several state transitions (in
reality some of these transitions are grouped together):

     <dl>
<dt>Download<dd>Fetch the package from somewhere.

     <br><dt>Install<dd>Unpack the package, or write a <samp><span class="file">.el</span></samp> file into the appropriate
install directory.  This step also includes extracting autoloads and
byte-compiling the Emacs Lisp code.

     <br><dt>Activate<dd>Update <code>load-path</code> and <code>Info-directory-list</code> and evaluate
the autoloads, so that the package is ready for the user to use. 
</dl>

   <p>It is best for users if packages do not do too much work at
activation time.  The best approach is to have activation consist of
some autoloads and little more.
