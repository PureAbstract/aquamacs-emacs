<h3 class="section">25.5 File Locks</h3>

<p><a name="index-file-locks-1918"></a><a name="index-lock-file-1919"></a>
  When two users edit the same file at the same time, they are likely
to interfere with each other.  Emacs tries to prevent this situation
from arising by recording a <dfn>file lock</dfn> when a file is being
modified.  (File locks are not implemented on Microsoft systems.) 
Emacs can then detect the first attempt to modify a buffer visiting a
file that is locked by another Emacs job, and ask the user what to do. 
The file lock is really a file, a symbolic link with a special name,
stored in the same directory as the file you are editing.

   <p>When you access files using NFS, there may be a small probability that
you and another user will both lock the same file &ldquo;simultaneously&rdquo;. 
If this happens, it is possible for the two users to make changes
simultaneously, but Emacs will still warn the user who saves second. 
Also, the detection of modification of a buffer visiting a file changed
on disk catches some cases of simultaneous editing; see
<a href="Modification-Time.html#Modification-Time">Modification Time</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-locked-p</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dlocked_002dp-1920"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>nil</code> if the file <var>filename</var> is not
locked.  It returns <code>t</code> if it is locked by this Emacs process, and
it returns the name of the user who has locked it if it is locked by
some other job.

     <pre class="example">          (file-locked-p "foo")
               &rArr; nil
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>lock-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional filename<a name="index-lock_002dbuffer-1921"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function locks the file <var>filename</var>, if the current buffer is
modified.  The argument <var>filename</var> defaults to the current buffer's
visited file.  Nothing is done if the current buffer is not visiting a
file, or is not modified, or if the system does not support locking. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>unlock-buffer</b><var><a name="index-unlock_002dbuffer-1922"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function unlocks the file being visited in the current buffer,
if the buffer is modified.  If the buffer is not modified, then
the file should not be locked, so this function does nothing.  It also
does nothing if the current buffer is not visiting a file, or if the
system does not support locking. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>File locking is not supported on some systems.  On systems that do not
support it, the functions <code>lock-buffer</code>, <code>unlock-buffer</code> and
<code>file-locked-p</code> do nothing and return <code>nil</code>.  It is also
possible to disable locking, by setting the variable <code>create-lockfiles</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>create-lockfiles</b><var><a name="index-create_002dlockfiles-1923"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, Emacs does not lock files. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>ask-user-about-lock</b><var> file other-user<a name="index-ask_002duser_002dabout_002dlock-1924"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is called when the user tries to modify <var>file</var>, but it
is locked by another user named <var>other-user</var>.  The default
definition of this function asks the user to say what to do.  The value
this function returns determines what Emacs does next:

          <ul>
<li>A value of <code>t</code> says to grab the lock on the file.  Then
this user may edit the file and <var>other-user</var> loses the lock.

          <li>A value of <code>nil</code> says to ignore the lock and let this
user edit the file anyway.

          <li><a name="index-file_002dlocked-1925"></a>This function may instead signal a <code>file-locked</code> error, in which
case the change that the user was about to make does not take place.

          <p>The error message for this error looks like this:

          <pre class="example">               error--&gt; File is locked: <var>file</var> <var>other-user</var>
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">where <code>file</code> is the name of the file and <var>other-user</var> is the
name of the user who has locked the file. 
</ul>

        <p>If you wish, you can replace the <code>ask-user-about-lock</code> function
with your own version that makes the decision in another way.  The code
for its usual definition is in <samp><span class="file">userlock.el</span></samp>.
