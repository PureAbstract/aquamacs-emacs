<h5 class="subsubsection">18.2.14.2 Edebug Display Update</h5>

<!-- This paragraph is not filled, because LaLiberte's conversion script -->
<!-- needs an xref to be on just one line. -->
<p>When Edebug needs to display something (e.g., in trace mode), it saves
the current window configuration from &ldquo;outside&rdquo; Edebug
(see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>).  When you exit Edebug, it restores
the previous window configuration.

   <p>Emacs redisplays only when it pauses.  Usually, when you continue
execution, the program re-enters Edebug at a breakpoint or after
stepping, without pausing or reading input in between.  In such cases,
Emacs never gets a chance to redisplay the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; configuration. 
Consequently, what you see is the same window configuration as the last
time Edebug was active, with no interruption.

   <p>Entry to Edebug for displaying something also saves and restores the
following data (though some of them are deliberately not restored if an
error or quit signal occurs).

     <ul>
<li><a name="index-current-buffer-point-and-mark-_0028Edebug_0029-1054"></a>Which buffer is current, and the positions of point and the mark in the
current buffer, are saved and restored.

     <li><a name="index-window-configuration-_0028Edebug_0029-1055"></a>The outside window configuration is saved and restored if
<code>edebug-save-windows</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (see <a href="Edebug-Options.html#Edebug-Options">Edebug Options</a>).

     <p>The window configuration is not restored on error or quit, but the
outside selected window <em>is</em> reselected even on error or quit in
case a <code>save-excursion</code> is active.  If the value of
<code>edebug-save-windows</code> is a list, only the listed windows are saved
and restored.

     <p>The window start and horizontal scrolling of the source code buffer are
not restored, however, so that the display remains coherent within Edebug.

     <li>The value of point in each displayed buffer is saved and restored if
<code>edebug-save-displayed-buffer-points</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.

     <li>The variables <code>overlay-arrow-position</code> and
<code>overlay-arrow-string</code> are saved and restored, so you can safely
invoke Edebug from the recursive edit elsewhere in the same buffer.

     <li><code>cursor-in-echo-area</code> is locally bound to <code>nil</code> so that
the cursor shows up in the window. 
</ul>
