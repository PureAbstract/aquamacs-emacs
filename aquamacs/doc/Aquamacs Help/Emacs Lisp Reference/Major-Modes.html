<h3 class="section">23.2 Major Modes</h3>

<p><a name="index-major-mode-1683"></a>
<a name="index-major-mode-command-1684"></a>  Major modes specialize Emacs for editing particular kinds of text. 
Each buffer has one major mode at a time.  Every major mode is
associated with a <dfn>major mode command</dfn>, whose name should end in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mode</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This command takes care of switching to that mode in the
current buffer, by setting various buffer-local variables such as a
local keymap.  See <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode Conventions</a>.

   <p>The least specialized major mode is called <dfn>Fundamental mode</dfn>,
which has no mode-specific definitions or variable settings.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>fundamental-mode</b><var><a name="index-fundamental_002dmode-1685"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the major mode command for Fundamental mode.  Unlike other mode
commands, it does <em>not</em> run any mode hooks (see <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode Conventions</a>), since you are not supposed to customize this mode. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The easiest way to write a major mode is to use the macro
<code>define-derived-mode</code>, which sets up the new mode as a variant of
an existing major mode.  See <a href="Derived-Modes.html#Derived-Modes">Derived Modes</a>.  We recommend using
<code>define-derived-mode</code> even if the new mode is not an obvious
derivative of another mode, as it automatically enforces many coding
conventions for you.  See <a href="Basic-Major-Modes.html#Basic-Major-Modes">Basic Major Modes</a>, for common modes to
derive from.

   <p>The standard GNU Emacs Lisp directory tree contains the code for
several major modes, in files such as <samp><span class="file">text-mode.el</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">texinfo.el</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">lisp-mode.el</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">rmail.el</span></samp>.  You can
study these libraries to see how modes are written.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>major-mode</b><var><a name="index-major_002dmode-1686"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The buffer-local value of this variable holds the symbol for the current
major mode.  Its default value holds the default major mode for new
buffers.  The standard default value is <code>fundamental-mode</code>.

        <p>If the default value is <code>nil</code>, then whenever Emacs creates a new
buffer via a command such as <kbd>C-x b</kbd> (<code>switch-to-buffer</code>), the
new buffer is put in the major mode of the previously current buffer. 
As an exception, if the major mode of the previous buffer has a
<code>mode-class</code> symbol property with value <code>special</code>, the new
buffer is put in Fundamental mode (see <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode Conventions</a>).
