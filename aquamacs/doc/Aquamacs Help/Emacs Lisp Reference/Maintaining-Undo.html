<h3 class="section">32.10 Maintaining Undo Lists</h3>

<p>This section describes how to enable and disable undo information for
a given buffer.  It also explains how the undo list is truncated
automatically so it doesn't get too big.

   <p>Recording of undo information in a newly created buffer is normally
enabled to start with; but if the buffer name starts with a space, the
undo recording is initially disabled.  You can explicitly enable or
disable undo recording with the following two functions, or by setting
<code>buffer-undo-list</code> yourself.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>buffer-enable-undo</b><var> &amp;optional buffer-or-name<a name="index-buffer_002denable_002dundo-2916"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command enables recording undo information for buffer
<var>buffer-or-name</var>, so that subsequent changes can be undone.  If no
argument is supplied, then the current buffer is used.  This function
does nothing if undo recording is already enabled in the buffer.  It
returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>In an interactive call, <var>buffer-or-name</var> is the current buffer. 
You cannot specify any other buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>buffer-disable-undo</b><var> &amp;optional buffer-or-name<a name="index-buffer_002ddisable_002dundo-2917"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-disabling-undo-2918"></a>This function discards the undo list of <var>buffer-or-name</var>, and disables
further recording of undo information.  As a result, it is no longer
possible to undo either previous changes or any subsequent changes.  If
the undo list of <var>buffer-or-name</var> is already disabled, this function
has no effect.

        <p>In an interactive call, BUFFER-OR-NAME is the current buffer.  You
cannot specify any other buffer.  This function returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>As editing continues, undo lists get longer and longer.  To prevent
them from using up all available memory space, garbage collection trims
them back to size limits you can set.  (For this purpose, the &ldquo;size&rdquo;
of an undo list measures the cons cells that make up the list, plus the
strings of deleted text.)  Three variables control the range of acceptable
sizes: <code>undo-limit</code>, <code>undo-strong-limit</code> and
<code>undo-outer-limit</code>.  In these variables, size is counted as the
number of bytes occupied, which includes both saved text and other
data.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>undo-limit</b><var><a name="index-undo_002dlimit-2919"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the soft limit for the acceptable size of an undo list.  The
change group at which this size is exceeded is the last one kept. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>undo-strong-limit</b><var><a name="index-undo_002dstrong_002dlimit-2920"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the upper limit for the acceptable size of an undo list.  The
change group at which this size is exceeded is discarded itself (along
with all older change groups).  There is one exception: the very latest
change group is only discarded if it exceeds <code>undo-outer-limit</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>undo-outer-limit</b><var><a name="index-undo_002douter_002dlimit-2921"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If at garbage collection time the undo info for the current command
exceeds this limit, Emacs discards the info and displays a warning. 
This is a last ditch limit to prevent memory overflow. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>undo-ask-before-discard</b><var><a name="index-undo_002dask_002dbefore_002ddiscard-2922"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, when the undo info exceeds
<code>undo-outer-limit</code>, Emacs asks in the echo area whether to
discard the info.  The default value is <code>nil</code>, which means to
discard it automatically.

        <p>This option is mainly intended for debugging.  Garbage collection is
inhibited while the question is asked, which means that Emacs might
leak memory if the user waits too long before answering the question. 
</p></blockquote></div>
