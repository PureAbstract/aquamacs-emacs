<h3 class="section">16.4 Dynamic Loading of Individual Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-dynamic-loading-of-functions-917"></a><a name="index-lazy-loading-918"></a>  When you compile a file, you can optionally enable the <dfn>dynamic
function loading</dfn> feature (also known as <dfn>lazy loading</dfn>).  With
dynamic function loading, loading the file doesn't fully read the
function definitions in the file.  Instead, each function definition
contains a place-holder which refers to the file.  The first time each
function is called, it reads the full definition from the file, to
replace the place-holder.

   <p>The advantage of dynamic function loading is that loading the file
becomes much faster.  This is a good thing for a file which contains
many separate user-callable functions, if using one of them does not
imply you will probably also use the rest.  A specialized mode which
provides many keyboard commands often has that usage pattern: a user may
invoke the mode, but use only a few of the commands it provides.

   <p>The dynamic loading feature has certain disadvantages:

     <ul>
<li>If you delete or move the compiled file after loading it, Emacs can no
longer load the remaining function definitions not already loaded.

     <li>If you alter the compiled file (such as by compiling a new version),
then trying to load any function not already loaded will usually yield
nonsense results. 
</ul>

   <p>These problems will never happen in normal circumstances with
installed Emacs files.  But they are quite likely to happen with Lisp
files that you are changing.  The easiest way to prevent these problems
is to reload the new compiled file immediately after each recompilation.

   <p>The byte compiler uses the dynamic function loading feature if the
variable <code>byte-compile-dynamic</code> is non-<code>nil</code> at compilation
time.  Do not set this variable globally, since dynamic loading is
desirable only for certain files.  Instead, enable the feature for
specific source files with file-local variable bindings.  For example,
you could do it by writing this text in the source file's first line:

<pre class="example">     -*-byte-compile-dynamic: t;-*-
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>byte-compile-dynamic</b><var><a name="index-byte_002dcompile_002ddynamic-919"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this is non-<code>nil</code>, the byte compiler generates compiled files
that are set up for dynamic function loading. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>fetch-bytecode</b><var> function<a name="index-fetch_002dbytecode-920"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If <var>function</var> is a byte-code function object, this immediately
finishes loading the byte code of <var>function</var> from its
byte-compiled file, if it is not fully loaded already.  Otherwise,
it does nothing.  It always returns <var>function</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>
