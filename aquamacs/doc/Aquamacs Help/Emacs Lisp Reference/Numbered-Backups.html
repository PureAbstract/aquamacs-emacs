<h4 class="subsection">26.1.3 Making and Deleting Numbered Backup Files</h4>

<p>If a file's name is <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>, the names of its numbered backup
versions are <samp><span class="file">foo.~</span><var>v</var><span class="file">~</span></samp>, for various integers <var>v</var>, like
this: <samp><span class="file">foo.~1~</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo.~2~</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">foo.~3~</span></samp>, <small class="dots">...</small>,
<samp><span class="file">foo.~259~</span></samp>, and so on.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>version-control</b><var><a name="index-version_002dcontrol-2096"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable controls whether to make a single non-numbered backup
file or multiple numbered backups.

          <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>Make numbered backups if the visited file already has numbered backups;
otherwise, do not.  This is the default.

          <br><dt><code>never</code><dd>Do not make numbered backups.

          <br><dt><var>anything else</var><dd>Make numbered backups. 
</dl>
        </p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The use of numbered backups ultimately leads to a large number of
backup versions, which must then be deleted.  Emacs can do this
automatically or it can ask the user whether to delete them.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>kept-new-versions</b><var><a name="index-kept_002dnew_002dversions-2097"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the number of newest versions to keep
when a new numbered backup is made.  The newly made backup is included
in the count.  The default value is&nbsp;2. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>kept-old-versions</b><var><a name="index-kept_002dold_002dversions-2098"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is the number of oldest versions to keep
when a new numbered backup is made.  The default value is&nbsp;2. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If there are backups numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and both of these
variables have the value 2, then the backups numbered 1 and 2 are kept
as old versions and those numbered 5 and 7 are kept as new versions;
backup version 3 is excess.  The function <code>find-backup-file-name</code>
(see <a href="Backup-Names.html#Backup-Names">Backup Names</a>) is responsible for determining which backup
versions to delete, but does not delete them itself.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>delete-old-versions</b><var><a name="index-delete_002dold_002dversions-2099"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is <code>t</code>, then saving a file deletes excess
backup versions silently.  If it is <code>nil</code>, that means
to ask for confirmation before deleting excess backups. 
Otherwise, they are not deleted at all. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>dired-kept-versions</b><var><a name="index-dired_002dkept_002dversions-2100"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies how many of the newest backup versions to keep
in the Dired command <kbd>.</kbd> (<code>dired-clean-directory</code>).  That's the
same thing <code>kept-new-versions</code> specifies when you make a new backup
file.  The default is&nbsp;2. 
</p></blockquote></div>
