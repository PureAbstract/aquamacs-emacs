<h3 class="section">16.3 Documentation Strings and Compilation</h3>

<p><a name="index-dynamic-loading-of-documentation-913"></a>
  Functions and variables loaded from a byte-compiled file access their
documentation strings dynamically from the file whenever needed.  This
saves space within Emacs, and makes loading faster because the
documentation strings themselves need not be processed while loading the
file.  Actual access to the documentation strings becomes slower as a
result, but this normally is not enough to bother users.

   <p>Dynamic access to documentation strings does have drawbacks:

     <ul>
<li>If you delete or move the compiled file after loading it, Emacs can no
longer access the documentation strings for the functions and variables
in the file.

     <li>If you alter the compiled file (such as by compiling a new version),
then further access to documentation strings in this file will
probably give nonsense results. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">These problems normally occur only if you build Emacs yourself and use
it from the directory where you built it, and you happen to edit
and/or recompile the Lisp source files.  They can be easily cured by
reloading each file after recompiling it.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0023_0040_0040_0040var_007bcount_007d_007d-914"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0023_0024_007d-915"></a>  The dynamic documentation string feature writes compiled files that
use a special Lisp reader construct, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#@</span><var>count</var></samp>&rsquo;.  This
construct skips the next <var>count</var> characters.  It also uses the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#$</span></samp>&rsquo; construct, which stands for &ldquo;the name of this file, as a
string&rdquo;.  It is usually best not to use these constructs in Lisp source
files, since they are not designed to be clear to humans reading the
file.

   <p>You can disable the dynamic documentation string feature at compile
time by setting <code>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</code> to <code>nil</code>;
this is useful mainly if you expect to change the file, and you want
Emacs processes that have already loaded it to keep working when the
file changes.  You can do this globally, or for one source file by
specifying a file-local binding for the variable.  One way to do that
is by adding this string to the file's first line:

<pre class="example">     -*-byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings: nil;-*-
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>byte-compile-dynamic-docstrings</b><var><a name="index-byte_002dcompile_002ddynamic_002ddocstrings-916"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this is non-<code>nil</code>, the byte compiler generates compiled files
that are set up for dynamic loading of documentation strings. 
</p></blockquote></div>
