<h4 class="subsection">11.9.4 Proper Use of Dynamic Scoping</h4>

<p>Binding a variable in one function and using it in another is a
powerful technique, but if used without restraint, it can make programs
hard to understand.  There are two clean ways to use this technique:

     <ul>
<li>Use or bind the variable only in a few related functions, written close
together in one file.  Such a variable is used for communication within
one program.

     <p>You should write comments to inform other programmers that they can see
all uses of the variable before them, and to advise them not to add uses
elsewhere.

     <li>Give the variable a well-defined, documented meaning, and make all
appropriate functions refer to it (but not bind it or set it) wherever
that meaning is relevant.  For example, the variable
<code>case-fold-search</code> is defined as &ldquo;non-<code>nil</code> means ignore case
when searching&rdquo;; various search and replace functions refer to it
directly or through their subroutines, but do not bind or set it.

     <p>Then you can bind the variable in other programs, knowing reliably what
the effect will be. 
</ul>

   <p>In either case, you should define the variable with <code>defvar</code>. 
This helps other people understand your program by telling them to look
for inter-function usage.  It also avoids a warning from the byte
compiler.  Choose the variable's name to avoid name conflicts&mdash;don't
use short names like <code>x</code>.
