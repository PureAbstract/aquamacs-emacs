<h4 class="subsection">37.9.1 Process Buffers</h4>

<p>A process can (and usually does) have an <dfn>associated buffer</dfn>,
which is an ordinary Emacs buffer that is used for two purposes: storing
the output from the process, and deciding when to kill the process.  You
can also use the buffer to identify a process to operate on, since in
normal practice only one process is associated with any given buffer. 
Many applications of processes also use the buffer for editing input to
be sent to the process, but this is not built into Emacs Lisp.

   <p>Unless the process has a filter function (see <a href="Filter-Functions.html#Filter-Functions">Filter Functions</a>),
its output is inserted in the associated buffer.  The position to insert
the output is determined by the <code>process-mark</code>, which is then
updated to point to the end of the text just inserted.  Usually, but not
always, the <code>process-mark</code> is at the end of the buffer.

   <p><a name="index-process_002dkill_002dbuffer_002dquery_002dfunction-3603"></a>  Killing the associated buffer of a process also kills the process. 
Emacs asks for confirmation first, if the process's
<code>process-query-on-exit-flag</code> is non-<code>nil</code> (see <a href="Query-Before-Exit.html#Query-Before-Exit">Query Before Exit</a>).  This confirmation is done by the function
<code>process-kill-buffer-query-function</code>, which is run from
<code>kill-buffer-query-functions</code> (see <a href="Killing-Buffers.html#Killing-Buffers">Killing Buffers</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>process-buffer</b><var> process<a name="index-process_002dbuffer-3604"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the associated buffer of the process
<var>process</var>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (process-buffer (get-process "shell"))
               &rArr; #&lt;buffer *shell*&gt;
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>process-mark</b><var> process<a name="index-process_002dmark-3605"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the process marker for <var>process</var>, which is the
marker that says where to insert output from the process.

        <p>If <var>process</var> does not have a buffer, <code>process-mark</code> returns a
marker that points nowhere.

        <p>Insertion of process output in a buffer uses this marker to decide where
to insert, and updates it to point after the inserted text.  That is why
successive batches of output are inserted consecutively.

        <p>Filter functions normally should use this marker in the same fashion
as is done by direct insertion of output in the buffer.  For an
example of a filter function that uses <code>process-mark</code>,
see <a href="Process-Filter-Example.html#Process-Filter-Example">Process Filter Example</a>.

        <p>When the user is expected to enter input in the process buffer for
transmission to the process, the process marker separates the new input
from previous output. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-process-buffer</b><var> process buffer<a name="index-set_002dprocess_002dbuffer-3606"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sets the buffer associated with <var>process</var> to
<var>buffer</var>.  If <var>buffer</var> is <code>nil</code>, the process becomes
associated with no buffer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>get-buffer-process</b><var> buffer-or-name<a name="index-get_002dbuffer_002dprocess-3607"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a nondeleted process associated with the buffer
specified by <var>buffer-or-name</var>.  If there are several processes
associated with it, this function chooses one (currently, the one most
recently created, but don't count on that).  Deletion of a process
(see <code>delete-process</code>) makes it ineligible for this function to
return.

        <p>It is usually a bad idea to have more than one process associated with
the same buffer.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (get-buffer-process "*shell*")
               &rArr; #&lt;process shell&gt;
</pre>
        <p>Killing the process's buffer deletes the process, which kills the
subprocess with a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal (see <a href="Signals-to-Processes.html#Signals-to-Processes">Signals to Processes</a>).
