<h4 class="subsection">18.2.8 Edebug Views</h4>

<p>These Edebug commands let you view aspects of the buffer and window
status as they were before entry to Edebug.  The outside window
configuration is the collection of windows and contents that were in
effect outside of Edebug.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>v</kbd><dd>Switch to viewing the outside window configuration
(<code>edebug-view-outside</code>).  Type <kbd>C-x X w</kbd> to return to Edebug.

     <br><dt><kbd>p</kbd><dd>Temporarily display the outside current buffer with point at its
outside position (<code>edebug-bounce-point</code>), pausing for one second
before returning to Edebug.  With a prefix argument <var>n</var>, pause for
<var>n</var> seconds instead.

     <br><dt><kbd>w</kbd><dd>Move point back to the current stop point in the source code buffer
(<code>edebug-where</code>).

     <p>If you use this command in a different window displaying the same
buffer, that window will be used instead to display the current
definition in the future.

     <br><dt><kbd>W</kbd><dd><!-- Its function is not simply to forget the saved configuration - dan -->
Toggle whether Edebug saves and restores the outside window
configuration (<code>edebug-toggle-save-windows</code>).

     <p>With a prefix argument, <code>W</code> only toggles saving and restoring of
the selected window.  To specify a window that is not displaying the
source code buffer, you must use <kbd>C-x X W</kbd> from the global keymap. 
</dl>

   <p>You can view the outside window configuration with <kbd>v</kbd> or just
bounce to the point in the current buffer with <kbd>p</kbd>, even if
it is not normally displayed.

   <p>After moving point, you may wish to jump back to the stop point. 
You can do that with <kbd>w</kbd> from a source code buffer.  You can jump
back to the stop point in the source code buffer from any buffer using
<kbd>C-x X w</kbd>.

   <p>Each time you use <kbd>W</kbd> to turn saving <em>off</em>, Edebug forgets the
saved outside window configuration&mdash;so that even if you turn saving
back <em>on</em>, the current window configuration remains unchanged when
you next exit Edebug (by continuing the program).  However, the
automatic redisplay of <samp><span class="file">*edebug*</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">*edebug-trace*</span></samp> may
conflict with the buffers you wish to see unless you have enough windows
open.
