<p><a name="index-finding-files-1886"></a><a name="index-visiting-files-1887"></a>
  Visiting a file means reading a file into a buffer.  Once this is
done, we say that the buffer is <dfn>visiting</dfn> that file, and call the
file &ldquo;the visited file&rdquo; of the buffer.

   <p>A file and a buffer are two different things.  A file is information
recorded permanently in the computer (unless you delete it).  A buffer,
on the other hand, is information inside of Emacs that will vanish at
the end of the editing session (or when you kill the buffer).  Usually,
a buffer contains information that you have copied from a file; then we
say the buffer is visiting that file.  The copy in the buffer is what
you modify with editing commands.  Such changes to the buffer do not
change the file; therefore, to make the changes permanent, you must
<dfn>save</dfn> the buffer, which means copying the altered buffer contents
back into the file.

   <p>In spite of the distinction between files and buffers, people often
refer to a file when they mean a buffer and vice-versa.  Indeed, we say,
&ldquo;I am editing a file&rdquo;, rather than, &ldquo;I am editing a buffer that I
will soon save as a file of the same name&rdquo;.  Humans do not usually need
to make the distinction explicit.  When dealing with a computer program,
however, it is good to keep the distinction in mind.
