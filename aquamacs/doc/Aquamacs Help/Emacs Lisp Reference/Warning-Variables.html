<h4 class="subsection">38.5.2 Warning Variables</h4>

<p>Programs can customize how their warnings appear by binding
the variables described in this section.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>warning-levels</b><var><a name="index-warning_002dlevels-3721"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This list defines the meaning and severity order of the warning
severity levels.  Each element defines one severity level,
and they are arranged in order of decreasing severity.

        <p>Each element has the form <code>(</code><var>level</var> <var>string</var>
<var>function</var><code>)</code>, where <var>level</var> is the severity level it defines. 
<var>string</var> specifies the textual description of this level. 
<var>string</var> should use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; to specify where to put the warning
type information, or it can omit the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>&rsquo; so as not to include
that information.

        <p>The optional <var>function</var>, if non-<code>nil</code>, is a function to call
with no arguments, to get the user's attention.

        <p>Normally you should not change the value of this variable. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>warning-prefix-function</b><var><a name="index-warning_002dprefix_002dfunction-3722"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, the value is a function to generate prefix text for
warnings.  Programs can bind the variable to a suitable function. 
<code>display-warning</code> calls this function with the warnings buffer
current, and the function can insert text in it.  That text becomes
the beginning of the warning message.

        <p>The function is called with two arguments, the severity level and its
entry in <code>warning-levels</code>.  It should return a list to use as the
entry (this value need not be an actual member of
<code>warning-levels</code>).  By constructing this value, the function can
change the severity of the warning, or specify different handling for
a given severity level.

        <p>If the variable's value is <code>nil</code> then there is no function
to call. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>warning-series</b><var><a name="index-warning_002dseries-3723"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Programs can bind this variable to <code>t</code> to say that the next
warning should begin a series.  When several warnings form a series,
that means to leave point on the first warning of the series, rather
than keep moving it for each warning so that it appears on the last one. 
The series ends when the local binding is unbound and
<code>warning-series</code> becomes <code>nil</code> again.

        <p>The value can also be a symbol with a function definition.  That is
equivalent to <code>t</code>, except that the next warning will also call
the function with no arguments with the warnings buffer current.  The
function can insert text which will serve as a header for the series
of warnings.

        <p>Once a series has begun, the value is a marker which points to the
buffer position in the warnings buffer of the start of the series.

        <p>The variable's normal value is <code>nil</code>, which means to handle
each warning separately. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>warning-fill-prefix</b><var><a name="index-warning_002dfill_002dprefix-3724"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>When this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, it specifies a fill prefix to
use for filling each warning's text. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>warning-type-format</b><var><a name="index-warning_002dtype_002dformat-3725"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies the format for displaying the warning type
in the warning message.  The result of formatting the type this way
gets included in the message under the control of the string in the
entry in <code>warning-levels</code>.  The default value is <code>" (%s)"</code>. 
If you bind it to <code>""</code> then the warning type won't appear at
all. 
</p></blockquote></div>
