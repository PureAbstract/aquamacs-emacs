<h3 class="section">38.8 Temporary Displays</h3>

<p>Temporary displays are used by Lisp programs to put output into a
buffer and then present it to the user for perusal rather than for
editing.  Many help commands use this feature.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>with-output-to-temp-buffer</b><var> buffer-name forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002doutput_002dto_002dtemp_002dbuffer-3743"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function executes <var>forms</var> while arranging to insert any output
they print into the buffer named <var>buffer-name</var>, which is first
created if necessary, and put into Help mode.  Finally, the buffer is
displayed in some window, but not selected.  (See the similar
form <code>with-temp-buffer-window</code> below.)

        <p>If the <var>forms</var> do not change the major mode in the output buffer,
so that it is still Help mode at the end of their execution, then
<code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> makes this buffer read-only at the
end, and also scans it for function and variable names to make them
into clickable cross-references.  See <a href="Docstring-hyperlinks.html#Docstring-hyperlinks">Tips for Documentation Strings</a>, in particular the item on hyperlinks in
documentation strings, for more details.

        <p>The string <var>buffer-name</var> specifies the temporary buffer, which
need not already exist.  The argument must be a string, not a buffer. 
The buffer is erased initially (with no questions asked), and it is
marked as unmodified after <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> exits.

        <p><code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> binds <code>standard-output</code> to the
temporary buffer, then it evaluates the forms in <var>forms</var>.  Output
using the Lisp output functions within <var>forms</var> goes by default to
that buffer (but screen display and messages in the echo area, although
they are &ldquo;output&rdquo; in the general sense of the word, are not affected). 
See <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>.

        <p>Several hooks are available for customizing the behavior
of this construct; they are listed below.

        <p>The value of the last form in <var>forms</var> is returned.

     <pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
           This is the contents of foo.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (with-output-to-temp-buffer "foo"
              (print 20)
              (print standard-output))
          &rArr; #&lt;buffer foo&gt;
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          20
          
          #&lt;buffer foo&gt;
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
</pre>

<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code>
calls it as a function to do the job of displaying a help buffer.  The
function gets one argument, which is the buffer it should display.

        <p>It is a good idea for this function to run <code>temp-buffer-show-hook</code>
just as <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> normally would, inside of
<code>save-selected-window</code> and with the chosen window and buffer
selected.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>temp-buffer-setup-hook</b><var><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dsetup_002dhook-3745"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This normal hook is run by <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> before
evaluating <var>body</var>.  When the hook runs, the temporary buffer is
current.  This hook is normally set up with a function to put the
buffer in Help mode.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>temp-buffer-show-hook</b><var><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dshow_002dhook-3746"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This normal hook is run by <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> after
displaying the temporary buffer.  When the hook runs, the temporary buffer
is current, and the window it was displayed in is selected. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>with-temp-buffer-window</b><var> buffer-or-name action quit-function forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002dtemp_002dbuffer_002dwindow-3747"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This macro is similar to <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code>. 
Like that construct, it executes <var>forms</var> while arranging to insert
any output they print into the buffer named <var>buffer-or-name</var>. 
Finally, the buffer is displayed in some window, but not selected. 
Unlike <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code>, this does not switch to Help
mode.

        <p>The argument <var>buffer-or-name</var> specifies the temporary buffer. 
It can be either a buffer, which must already exist, or a string,
in which case a buffer of that name is created if necessary. 
The buffer is marked as unmodified and read-only when
<code>with-temp-buffer-window</code> exits.

        <p>This macro does not call <code>temp-buffer-show-function</code>.  Rather, it
passes the <var>action</var> argument to <code>display-buffer</code> in order to
display the buffer.

        <p>The value of the last form in <var>forms</var> is returned, unless the
argument <var>quit-function</var> is specified.  In that case,
it is called with two arguments: the window showing the buffer
and the result of <var>forms</var>.  The final return value is then
whatever <var>quit-function</var> returns.

        <p><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dwindow_002dsetup_002dhook-3748"></a><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dwindow_002dshow_002dhook-3749"></a>This macro uses the normal hooks <code>temp-buffer-window-setup-hook</code>
and <code>temp-buffer-window-show-hook</code> in place of the analogous hooks
run by <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>momentary-string-display</b><var> string position &amp;optional char message<a name="index-momentary_002dstring_002ddisplay-3750"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function momentarily displays <var>string</var> in the current buffer at
<var>position</var>.  It has no effect on the undo list or on the buffer's
modification status.

        <p>The momentary display remains until the next input event.  If the next
input event is <var>char</var>, <code>momentary-string-display</code> ignores it
and returns.  Otherwise, that event remains buffered for subsequent use
as input.  Thus, typing <var>char</var> will simply remove the string from
the display, while typing (say) <kbd>C-f</kbd> will remove the string from
the display and later (presumably) move point forward.  The argument
<var>char</var> is a space by default.

        <p>The return value of <code>momentary-string-display</code> is not meaningful.

        <p>If the string <var>string</var> does not contain control characters, you can
do the same job in a more general way by creating (and then subsequently
deleting) an overlay with a <code>before-string</code> property. 
See <a href="Overlay-Properties.html#Overlay-Properties">Overlay Properties</a>.

        <p>If <var>message</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it is displayed in the echo area
while <var>string</var> is displayed in the buffer.  If it is <code>nil</code>, a
default message says to type <var>char</var> to continue.

        <p>In this example, point is initially located at the beginning of the
second line:

     <pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          This is the contents of foo.
          -!-Second line.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (momentary-string-display
            "**** Important Message! ****"
            (point) ?\r
            "Type RET when done reading")
          &rArr; t
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          This is the contents of foo.
          **** Important Message! ****Second line.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          ---------- Echo Area ----------
          Type RET when done reading
          ---------- Echo Area ----------
