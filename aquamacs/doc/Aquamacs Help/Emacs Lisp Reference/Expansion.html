<h3 class="section">13.2 Expansion of a Macro Call</h3>

<p><a name="index-expansion-of-macros-783"></a><a name="index-macro-call-784"></a>
  A macro call looks just like a function call in that it is a list which
starts with the name of the macro.  The rest of the elements of the list
are the arguments of the macro.

   <p>Evaluation of the macro call begins like evaluation of a function call
except for one crucial difference: the macro arguments are the actual
expressions appearing in the macro call.  They are not evaluated before
they are given to the macro definition.  By contrast, the arguments of a
function are results of evaluating the elements of the function call
list.

   <p>Having obtained the arguments, Lisp invokes the macro definition just
as a function is invoked.  The argument variables of the macro are bound
to the argument values from the macro call, or to a list of them in the
case of a <code>&amp;rest</code> argument.  And the macro body executes and
returns its value just as a function body does.

   <p>The second crucial difference between macros and functions is that
the value returned by the macro body is an alternate Lisp expression,
also known as the <dfn>expansion</dfn> of the macro.  The Lisp interpreter
proceeds to evaluate the expansion as soon as it comes back from the
macro.

   <p>Since the expansion is evaluated in the normal manner, it may contain
calls to other macros.  It may even be a call to the same macro, though
this is unusual.

   <p>Note that Emacs tries to expand macros when loading an uncompiled
Lisp file.  This is not always possible, but if it is, it speeds up
subsequent execution.  See <a href="How-Programs-Do-Loading.html#How-Programs-Do-Loading">How Programs Do Loading</a>.

   <p>You can see the expansion of a given macro call by calling
<code>macroexpand</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>macroexpand</b><var> form &amp;optional environment<a name="index-macroexpand-785"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-macro-expansion-786"></a>This function expands <var>form</var>, if it is a macro call.  If the result
is another macro call, it is expanded in turn, until something which is
not a macro call results.  That is the value returned by
<code>macroexpand</code>.  If <var>form</var> is not a macro call to begin with, it
is returned as given.

        <p>Note that <code>macroexpand</code> does not look at the subexpressions of
<var>form</var> (although some macro definitions may do so).  Even if they
are macro calls themselves, <code>macroexpand</code> does not expand them.

        <p>The function <code>macroexpand</code> does not expand calls to inline functions. 
Normally there is no need for that, since a call to an inline function is
no harder to understand than a call to an ordinary function.

        <p>If <var>environment</var> is provided, it specifies an alist of macro
definitions that shadow the currently defined macros.  Byte compilation
uses this feature.

     <pre class="example">          (defmacro inc (var)
              (list 'setq var (list '1+ var)))
          
          (macroexpand '(inc r))
               &rArr; (setq r (1+ r))
          
          (defmacro inc2 (var1 var2)
              (list 'progn (list 'inc var1) (list 'inc var2)))
          
          (macroexpand '(inc2 r s))
               &rArr; (progn (inc r) (inc s))  ; <code>inc</code><span class="roman"> not expanded here.</span>
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>macroexpand-all</b><var> form &amp;optional environment<a name="index-macroexpand_002dall-787"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><code>macroexpand-all</code> expands macros like <code>macroexpand</code>, but
will look for and expand all macros in <var>form</var>, not just at the
top-level.  If no macros are expanded, the return value is <code>eq</code>
to <var>form</var>.

        <p>Repeating the example used for <code>macroexpand</code> above with
<code>macroexpand-all</code>, we see that <code>macroexpand-all</code> <em>does</em>
expand the embedded calls to <code>inc</code>:

     <pre class="example">          (macroexpand-all '(inc2 r s))
               &rArr; (progn (setq r (1+ r)) (setq s (1+ s)))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
