<h3 class="section">37.3 Creating a Synchronous Process</h3>

<p><a name="index-synchronous-subprocess-3548"></a>
  After a <dfn>synchronous process</dfn> is created, Emacs waits for the
process to terminate before continuing.  Starting Dired on GNU or
Unix<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> is an example of this: it
runs <code>ls</code> in a synchronous process, then modifies the output
slightly.  Because the process is synchronous, the entire directory
listing arrives in the buffer before Emacs tries to do anything with it.

   <p>While Emacs waits for the synchronous subprocess to terminate, the
user can quit by typing <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  The first <kbd>C-g</kbd> tries to kill
the subprocess with a <code>SIGINT</code> signal; but it waits until the
subprocess actually terminates before quitting.  If during that time the
user types another <kbd>C-g</kbd>, that kills the subprocess instantly with
<code>SIGKILL</code> and quits immediately (except on MS-DOS, where killing
other processes doesn't work).  See <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>.

   <p>The synchronous subprocess functions return an indication of how the
process terminated.

   <p>The output from a synchronous subprocess is generally decoded using a
coding system, much like text read from a file.  The input sent to a
subprocess by <code>call-process-region</code> is encoded using a coding
system, much like text written into a file.  See <a href="Coding-Systems.html#Coding-Systems">Coding Systems</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>call-process</b><var> program &amp;optional infile destination display &amp;rest args<a name="index-call_002dprocess-3549"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function calls <var>program</var> and waits for it to finish.

        <p>The current working directory of the subprocess is
<code>default-directory</code>.

        <p>The standard input for the new process comes from file <var>infile</var> if
<var>infile</var> is not <code>nil</code>, and from the null device otherwise. 
The argument <var>destination</var> says where to put the process output. 
Here are the possibilities:

          <dl>
<dt>a buffer<dd>Insert the output in that buffer, before point.  This includes both the
standard output stream and the standard error stream of the process.

          <br><dt>a string<dd>Insert the output in a buffer with that name, before point.

          <br><dt><code>t</code><dd>Insert the output in the current buffer, before point.

          <br><dt><code>nil</code><dd>Discard the output.

          <br><dt>0<dd>Discard the output, and return <code>nil</code> immediately without waiting
for the subprocess to finish.

          <p>In this case, the process is not truly synchronous, since it can run in
parallel with Emacs; but you can think of it as synchronous in that
Emacs is essentially finished with the subprocess as soon as this
function returns.

          <p>MS-DOS doesn't support asynchronous subprocesses, so this option doesn't
work there.

          <br><dt><code>(:file </code><var>file-name</var><code>)</code><dd>Send the output to the file name specified, overwriting it if it
already exists.

          <br><dt><code>(</code><var>real-destination</var> <var>error-destination</var><code>)</code><dd>Keep the standard output stream separate from the standard error stream;
deal with the ordinary output as specified by <var>real-destination</var>,
and dispose of the error output according to <var>error-destination</var>. 
If <var>error-destination</var> is <code>nil</code>, that means to discard the
error output, <code>t</code> means mix it with the ordinary output, and a
string specifies a file name to redirect error output into.

          <p>You can't directly specify a buffer to put the error output in; that is
too difficult to implement.  But you can achieve this result by sending
the error output to a temporary file and then inserting the file into a
buffer. 
</dl>

        <p>If <var>display</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <code>call-process</code> redisplays
the buffer as output is inserted.  (However, if the coding system chosen
for decoding output is <code>undecided</code>, meaning deduce the encoding
from the actual data, then redisplay sometimes cannot continue once
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters are encountered.  There are fundamental
reasons why it is hard to fix this; see <a href="Output-from-Processes.html#Output-from-Processes">Output from Processes</a>.)

        <p>Otherwise the function <code>call-process</code> does no redisplay, and the
results become visible on the screen only when Emacs redisplays that
buffer in the normal course of events.

        <p>The remaining arguments, <var>args</var>, are strings that specify command
line arguments for the program.

        <p>The value returned by <code>call-process</code> (unless you told it not to
wait) indicates the reason for process termination.  A number gives the
exit status of the subprocess; 0 means success, and any other value
means failure.  If the process terminated with a signal,
<code>call-process</code> returns a string describing the signal.

        <p>In the examples below, the buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; is current.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (call-process "pwd" nil t)
               &rArr; 0
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          /home/lewis/manual
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (call-process "grep" nil "bar" nil "lewis" "/etc/passwd")
               &rArr; 0
          
          ---------- Buffer: bar ----------
          lewis:x:1001:1001:Bil Lewis,,,,:/home/lewis:/bin/bash
          
          ---------- Buffer: bar ----------
</pre>
        <p>Here is an example of the use of <code>call-process</code>, as used to
be found in the definition of the <code>insert-directory</code> function:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (call-process insert-directory-program nil t nil switches
                        (if full-directory-p
                            (concat (file-name-as-directory file) ".")
                          file))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>process-file</b><var> program &amp;optional infile buffer display &amp;rest args<a name="index-process_002dfile-3550"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function processes files synchronously in a separate process.  It
is similar to <code>call-process</code>, but may invoke a file handler based
on the value of the variable <code>default-directory</code>, which specifies
the current working directory of the subprocess.

        <p>The arguments are handled in almost the same way as for
<code>call-process</code>, with the following differences:

        <p>Some file handlers may not support all combinations and forms of the
arguments <var>infile</var>, <var>buffer</var>, and <var>display</var>.  For example,
some file handlers might behave as if <var>display</var> were <code>nil</code>,
regardless of the value actually passed.  As another example, some
file handlers might not support separating standard output and error
output by way of the <var>buffer</var> argument.

        <p>If a file handler is invoked, it determines the program to run based
on the first argument <var>program</var>.  For instance, suppose that a
handler for remote files is invoked.  Then the path that is used for
searching for the program might be different from <code>exec-path</code>.

        <p>The second argument <var>infile</var> may invoke a file handler.  The file
handler could be different from the handler chosen for the
<code>process-file</code> function itself.  (For example,
<code>default-directory</code> could be on one remote host, and
<var>infile</var> on a different remote host.  Or <code>default-directory</code>
could be non-special, whereas <var>infile</var> is on a remote host.)

        <p>If <var>buffer</var> is a list of the form <code>(</code><var>real-destination</var>
<var>error-destination</var><code>)</code>, and <var>error-destination</var> names a file,
then the same remarks as for <var>infile</var> apply.

        <p>The remaining arguments (<var>args</var>) will be passed to the process
verbatim.  Emacs is not involved in processing file names that are
present in <var>args</var>.  To avoid confusion, it may be best to avoid
absolute file names in <var>args</var>, but rather to specify all file
names as relative to <code>default-directory</code>.  The function
<code>file-relative-name</code> is useful for constructing such relative
file names.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>process-file-side-effects</b><var><a name="index-process_002dfile_002dside_002deffects-3551"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable indicates whether a call of <code>process-file</code> changes
remote files.

        <p>By default, this variable is always set to <code>t</code>, meaning that a
call of <code>process-file</code> could potentially change any file on a
remote host.  When set to <code>nil</code>, a file handler could optimize
its behavior with respect to remote file attribute caching.

        <p>You should only ever change this variable with a let-binding; never
with <code>setq</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>call-process-region</b><var> start end program &amp;optional delete destination display &amp;rest args<a name="index-call_002dprocess_002dregion-3552"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sends the text from <var>start</var> to <var>end</var> as
standard input to a process running <var>program</var>.  It deletes the text
sent if <var>delete</var> is non-<code>nil</code>; this is useful when
<var>destination</var> is <code>t</code>, to insert the output in the current
buffer in place of the input.

        <p>The arguments <var>destination</var> and <var>display</var> control what to do
with the output from the subprocess, and whether to update the display
as it comes in.  For details, see the description of
<code>call-process</code>, above.  If <var>destination</var> is the integer 0,
<code>call-process-region</code> discards the output and returns <code>nil</code>
immediately, without waiting for the subprocess to finish (this only
works if asynchronous subprocesses are supported; i.e., not on MS-DOS).

        <p>The remaining arguments, <var>args</var>, are strings that specify command
line arguments for the program.

        <p>The return value of <code>call-process-region</code> is just like that of
<code>call-process</code>: <code>nil</code> if you told it to return without
waiting; otherwise, a number or string which indicates how the
subprocess terminated.

        <p>In the following example, we use <code>call-process-region</code> to run the
<code>cat</code> utility, with standard input being the first five characters
in buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; (the word &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">input</span></samp>&rsquo;).  <code>cat</code> copies its
standard input into its standard output.  Since the argument
<var>destination</var> is <code>t</code>, this output is inserted in the current
buffer.

     <pre class="smallexample">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          input-!-
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (call-process-region 1 6 "cat" nil t)
               &rArr; 0
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          inputinput-!-
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
</pre>
        <p>For example, the <code>shell-command-on-region</code> command uses
<code>call-process-region</code> in a manner similar to this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (call-process-region
           start end
           shell-file-name      ; <span class="roman">name of program</span>
           nil                  ; <span class="roman">do not delete region</span>
           buffer               ; <span class="roman">send output to </span><code>buffer</code>
           nil                  ; <span class="roman">no redisplay during output</span>
           "-c" command)        ; <span class="roman">arguments for the shell</span>
</pre>
