<h3 class="section">13.7 Indenting Macros</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>declare</code> form in the macro definition to
specify how to &lt;TAB&gt; should indent calls to the macro.  You
write it like this:

<pre class="example">     (declare (indent <var>indent-spec</var>))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here are the possibilities for <var>indent-spec</var>:

     <dl>
<dt><code>nil</code><dd>This is the same as no property&mdash;use the standard indentation pattern. 
<br><dt><code>defun</code><dd>Handle this function like a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">def</span></samp>&rsquo; construct: treat the second
line as the start of a <dfn>body</dfn>. 
<br><dt>an integer, <var>number</var><dd>The first <var>number</var> arguments of the function are
<dfn>distinguished</dfn> arguments; the rest are considered the body
of the expression.  A line in the expression is indented according to
whether the first argument on it is distinguished or not.  If the
argument is part of the body, the line is indented <code>lisp-body-indent</code>
more columns than the open-parenthesis starting the containing
expression.  If the argument is distinguished and is either the first
or second argument, it is indented <em>twice</em> that many extra columns. 
If the argument is distinguished and not the first or second argument,
the line uses the standard pattern. 
<br><dt>a symbol, <var>symbol</var><dd><var>symbol</var> should be a function name; that function is called to
calculate the indentation of a line within this expression.  The
function receives two arguments:
          <dl>
<dt><var>state</var><dd>The value returned by <code>parse-partial-sexp</code> (a Lisp primitive for
indentation and nesting computation) when it parses up to the
beginning of this line. 
<br><dt><var>pos</var><dd>The position at which the line being indented begins. 
</dl>
     It should return either a number, which is the number of columns of
indentation for that line, or a list whose car is such a number.  The
difference between returning a number and returning a list is that a
number says that all following lines at the same nesting level should
be indented just like this one; a list says that following lines might
call for different indentations.  This makes a difference when the
indentation is being computed by <kbd>C-M-q</kbd>; if the value is a
number, <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> need not recalculate indentation for the following
lines until the end of the list. 
</dl>
