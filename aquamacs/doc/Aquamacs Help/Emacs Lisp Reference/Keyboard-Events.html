<h4 class="subsection">21.7.1 Keyboard Events</h4>

<p><a name="index-keyboard-events-1357"></a>
There are two kinds of input you can get from the keyboard: ordinary
keys, and function keys.  Ordinary keys correspond to characters; the
events they generate are represented in Lisp as characters.  The event
type of a character event is the character itself (an integer); see
<a href="Classifying-Events.html#Classifying-Events">Classifying Events</a>.

   <p><a name="index-modifier-bits-_0028of-input-character_0029-1358"></a><a name="index-basic-code-_0028of-input-character_0029-1359"></a>An input character event consists of a <dfn>basic code</dfn> between 0 and
524287, plus any or all of these <dfn>modifier bits</dfn>:

     <dl>
<dt>meta<dd>The
2**27
bit in the character code indicates a character
typed with the meta key held down.

     <br><dt>control<dd>The
2**26
bit in the character code indicates a non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
control character.

     <p><span class="sc">ascii</span> control characters such as <kbd>C-a</kbd> have special basic
codes of their own, so Emacs needs no special bit to indicate them. 
Thus, the code for <kbd>C-a</kbd> is just 1.

     <p>But if you type a control combination not in <acronym>ASCII</acronym>, such as
<kbd>%</kbd> with the control key, the numeric value you get is the code
for <kbd>%</kbd> plus
2**26
(assuming the terminal supports non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
control characters).

     <br><dt>shift<dd>The
2**25
bit in the character code indicates an <acronym>ASCII</acronym> control
character typed with the shift key held down.

     <p>For letters, the basic code itself indicates upper versus lower case;
for digits and punctuation, the shift key selects an entirely different
character with a different basic code.  In order to keep within the
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character set whenever possible, Emacs avoids using the
2**25
bit for those characters.

     <p>However, <acronym>ASCII</acronym> provides no way to distinguish <kbd>C-A</kbd> from
<kbd>C-a</kbd>, so Emacs uses the
2**25
bit in <kbd>C-A</kbd> and not in
<kbd>C-a</kbd>.

     <br><dt>hyper<dd>The
2**24
bit in the character code indicates a character
typed with the hyper key held down.

     <br><dt>super<dd>The
2**23
bit in the character code indicates a character
typed with the super key held down.

     <br><dt>alt<dd>The
2**22
bit in the character code indicates a character typed with the alt key
held down.  (The key labeled &lt;Alt&gt; on most keyboards is actually
treated as the meta key, not this.) 
</dl>

   <p>It is best to avoid mentioning specific bit numbers in your program. 
To test the modifier bits of a character, use the function
<code>event-modifiers</code> (see <a href="Classifying-Events.html#Classifying-Events">Classifying Events</a>).  When making key
bindings, you can use the read syntax for characters with modifier bits
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\C-</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\M-</span></samp>&rsquo;, and so on).  For making key bindings with
<code>define-key</code>, you can use lists such as <code>(control hyper ?x)</code> to
specify the characters (see <a href="Changing-Key-Bindings.html#Changing-Key-Bindings">Changing Key Bindings</a>).  The function
<code>event-convert-list</code> converts such a list into an event type
(see <a href="Classifying-Events.html#Classifying-Events">Classifying Events</a>).
