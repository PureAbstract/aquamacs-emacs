<h4 class="subsection">37.9.4 Accepting Output from Processes</h4>

<p><a name="index-accept-input-from-processes-3615"></a>
  Output from asynchronous subprocesses normally arrives only while
Emacs is waiting for some sort of external event, such as elapsed time
or terminal input.  Occasionally it is useful in a Lisp program to
explicitly permit output to arrive at a specific point, or even to wait
until output arrives from a process.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>accept-process-output</b><var> &amp;optional process seconds millisec just-this-one<a name="index-accept_002dprocess_002doutput-3616"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function allows Emacs to read pending output from processes.  The
output is inserted in the associated buffers or given to their filter
functions.  If <var>process</var> is non-<code>nil</code> then this function does
not return until some output has been received from <var>process</var>.

        <p>The arguments <var>seconds</var> and <var>millisec</var> let you specify timeout
periods.  The former specifies a period measured in seconds and the
latter specifies one measured in milliseconds.  The two time periods
thus specified are added together, and <code>accept-process-output</code>
returns after that much time, whether or not there has been any
subprocess output.

        <p>The argument <var>millisec</var> is obsolete (and should not be used),
because <var>seconds</var> can be a floating point number to specify
waiting a fractional number of seconds.  If <var>seconds</var> is 0, the
function accepts whatever output is pending but does not wait.

     <!-- Emacs 22.1 feature -->
        <p>If <var>process</var> is a process, and the argument <var>just-this-one</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, only output from that process is handled, suspending output
from other processes until some output has been received from that
process or the timeout expires.  If <var>just-this-one</var> is an integer,
also inhibit running timers.  This feature is generally not
recommended, but may be necessary for specific applications, such as
speech synthesis.

        <p>The function <code>accept-process-output</code> returns non-<code>nil</code> if it
did get some output, or <code>nil</code> if the timeout expired before output
arrived.
