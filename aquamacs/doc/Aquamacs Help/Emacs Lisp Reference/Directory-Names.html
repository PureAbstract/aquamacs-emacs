<h4 class="subsection">25.8.3 Directory Names</h4>

<p><a name="index-directory-name-1851"></a><a name="index-file-name-of-directory-1852"></a>
  A <dfn>directory name</dfn> is the name of a directory.  A directory is
actually a kind of file, so it has a file name, which is related to
the directory name but not identical to it.  (This is not quite the
same as the usual Unix terminology.)  These two different names for
the same entity are related by a syntactic transformation.  On GNU and
Unix systems, this is simple: a directory name ends in a slash,
whereas the directory's name as a file lacks that slash.  On MS-DOS
the relationship is more complicated.

   <p>The difference between a directory name and its name as a file is
subtle but crucial.  When an Emacs variable or function argument is
described as being a directory name, a file name of a directory is not
acceptable.  When <code>file-name-directory</code> returns a string, that is
always a directory name.

   <p>The following two functions convert between directory names and file
names.  They do nothing special with environment variable substitutions
such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$HOME</span></samp>&rsquo;, and the constructs &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">..</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>file-name-as-directory</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dname_002das_002ddirectory-1853"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a string representing <var>filename</var> in a form
that the operating system will interpret as the name of a directory.  On
most systems, this means appending a slash to the string (if it does not
already end in one).

     <pre class="example">          (file-name-as-directory "~rms/lewis")
               &rArr; "~rms/lewis/"
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>directory-file-name</b><var> dirname<a name="index-directory_002dfile_002dname-1854"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a string representing <var>dirname</var> in a form that
the operating system will interpret as the name of a file.  On most
systems, this means removing the final slash (or backslash) from the
string.

     <pre class="example">          (directory-file-name "~lewis/")
               &rArr; "~lewis"
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>Given a directory name, you can combine it with a relative file name
using <code>concat</code>:

<pre class="example">     (concat <var>dirname</var> <var>relfile</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Be sure to verify that the file name is relative before doing that. 
If you use an absolute file name, the results could be syntactically
invalid or refer to the wrong file.

   <p>If you want to use a directory file name in making such a
combination, you must first convert it to a directory name using
<code>file-name-as-directory</code>:

<pre class="example">     (concat (file-name-as-directory <var>dirfile</var>) <var>relfile</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Don't try concatenating a slash by hand, as in

<pre class="example">     ;;; <span class="roman">Wrong!</span>
     (concat <var>dirfile</var> "/" <var>relfile</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">because this is not portable.  Always use
<code>file-name-as-directory</code>.

   <p><a name="index-directory-name-abbreviation-1855"></a>  Directory name abbreviations are useful for directories that are
normally accessed through symbolic links.  Sometimes the users recognize
primarily the link's name as &ldquo;the name&rdquo; of the directory, and find it
annoying to see the directory's &ldquo;real&rdquo; name.  If you define the link
name as an abbreviation for the &ldquo;real&rdquo; name, Emacs shows users the
abbreviation instead.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>directory-abbrev-alist</b><var><a name="index-directory_002dabbrev_002dalist-1856"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The variable <code>directory-abbrev-alist</code> contains an alist of
abbreviations to use for file directories.  Each element has the form
<code>(</code><var>from</var><code> . </code><var>to</var><code>)</code>, and says to replace <var>from</var> with
<var>to</var> when it appears in a directory name.  The <var>from</var> string is
actually a regular expression; it should always start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\`</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The <var>to</var> string should be an ordinary absolute directory name.  Do
not use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; to stand for a home directory in that string.  The
function <code>abbreviate-file-name</code> performs these substitutions.

        <p>You can set this variable in <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> to describe the
abbreviations appropriate for your site.

        <p>Here's an example, from a system on which file system <samp><span class="file">/home/fsf</span></samp>
and so on are normally accessed through symbolic links named <samp><span class="file">/fsf</span></samp>
and so on.

     <pre class="example">          (("\\`/home/fsf" . "/fsf")
           ("\\`/home/gp" . "/gp")
           ("\\`/home/gd" . "/gd"))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>To convert a directory name to its abbreviation, use this
function:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>abbreviate-file-name</b><var> filename<a name="index-abbreviate_002dfile_002dname-1857"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="Definition-of-abbreviate_002dfile_002dname"></a>This function applies abbreviations from <code>directory-abbrev-alist</code>
to its argument, and also substitutes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; for the user's home
directory if the argument names a file in the home directory or one of
its subdirectories.  (If the home directory is a root directory, it is
not replaced with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo;, because this does not make the result
shorter on many systems.)  You can use it for directory names and for
file names, because it recognizes abbreviations even as part of the
name.
