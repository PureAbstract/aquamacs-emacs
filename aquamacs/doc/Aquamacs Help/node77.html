<P>

<UL>
<LI>Aquamacs should not complain about missing fonts any more when
    you have upgraded from earlier versions and set scalable fonts as
    default fonts for modes or all frames. They get filtered  automatically.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Users with certain setups (cyrillic Lucida Grande) should not get
    a ``default font not found'' error any more.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>``Recursive Minibuffers'' are enabled. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>``Subscribe to mailing list'' in Help menu.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>PHP-Mode included (M-x php-mode).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Ruby-Mode included (M-x ruby-mode)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>yes-or-no-p is customizable now. Use the new customization
 	variable aquamacs-quick-yes-or-no-prompt. (Thanks: Pavel Hlavnicka.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Soft word wrap (longlines-mode) is available from the Options
	menu. To make it the default, add this to your preferences
	file:	
	<TT>(set-default 'longlines-mode t)</TT>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Case-insensitive search option has gone into ``search'' submenu (in ``Edit'').

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If you are in an empty frame (i.e. a frame with an empty buffer)
	and you load (find) a file, Aquamacs will not open an additional frame.
	This is useful also for drag and drops, when a scratch frame is open.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The secondary selection is back: use the Command (Apple) key
    together with clicking/dragging the mouse cursor over text in
    order to select text that is not related to the point
    (cursor). This way, you can select text and then scroll somewhere
    else. Extend your selection with shift-command-mouse1.
    To copy/cut the text in the secondary selection to the  clipboard, use
    Shift-Command-C/X, respectively.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Some key-bindings are more like the original Emacs ones-in
    particular M-w, which does kill-ring-save again.
    (Idea: Joe Davison)   Also, Home and End keys work as expected.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>No more annoying system ``ding'' (bell ringing) all the time.  The bell is
    turned off completely, until Emacs developers eliminate the use of
    the bell on user-initiated abort actions (such as ESC ESC ESC when
    in minibuffer, of pressing Cancel in the file selection dialog).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The toolbar is only displayed in normal frames, but not
    in frames that show help/info buffers. (tool-bar+ and
    aquamacs-tool-bar packages). Turn such toolbars on/off in
    Options/Show/Hide menu.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The ``About Emacs'' dialogue has been improved.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Key combinations with the option key that  involve
    another modifier (that is, ctrl or command) will now work, even
    though simple option combinations are handled by the system to
    produce special characters.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The Speedbar is back. Activate in Options/ Show/Hide.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The redo function is in the Edit menu now.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>New buffers (File / New) open in Text Adapt Fill mode now.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>.save-places and customizations.el do not show up in the recent  files list
    any more.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>auto-save-files (in / Users / yourname /.emacs.d) are now saved to / Users / yourname/Library/Preferences.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>``Save Place in Files in between sessions'' will not generate  files in the
    user's home folder any more. Instead, the file goes into
    / Users / yourname/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/ where it belongs.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Command-' now cycles between different windows (suggested  by Joseph Kiniry.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Option is mapped to Meta by default, allowing you to enter key
    combinations such as C-M- easily. If you'd like to map it to
    alt instead, just add this to your .emacs:

<P>
<TT>(setq mac-option-modifier 'alt)</TT>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Color Themes: The color-themes package has been integrated in
    Aquamacs. Use the Option/Color Theme... menu command to choose a
    set of predefined colors for editing source code or writing
    texts. This applies to the current frame only, but you can make it
    the default for all new frames or for all frames in a specific
    mode with the according menu commands.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There is a new customization group called ``Aquamacs'' that
    allows you to modify the customizations introduced by Aquamacs.
    This is fairly untested - unexpected results may occur. If so, try
    to locate and fix the bug and send us a patch. If you couldn't
    find the problem, please report via Help/Send Bug Report...
    PLEASE NOTE that a lot of customization variables have changed
    their names--usually, you just need to prepend 1on1  to them.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Aquamacs will load your configuration files not just from
    / Users / yourname/.emacs, but also from the location that is appropriate for a Mac
    OS X installation:

<P>
/ Library/ Preferences /Aquamacs Emacs / Preferences.el
<BR>/ Users / yourname/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el
<BR>  /Library/Preferences / Emacs / Preferences.el
<BR> / Users / yourname / Library/Preferences/Emacs/Preferences.el
<BR>
<P>
It is recommended to use these instead of / Users / yourname/.emacs on OS X-only
    installations. The first two files should be used for the
    host-wide and user-specific Aquamacs configs, the latter two for
    general Emacs configurations.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>There is a new configuration option that gives you more fine-grained
    control over how the option modifier key is handled.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If mac-pass-option-to system is nil, your Aquamacs will get all key
    combinations. If you press option-3, Aquamacs will see ``M-3'' (or,
    depending on mac-option-modifier ``A-3''). If it is non-nil, you
    will simply get the pound sign  on a US keyboard.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>TeXniScope support in LaTeX mode (if installed in /Applications).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We have two great manuals available comfortably via Apple Help  now,
    directly from within Aquamacs Emacs (Help menu). There is a
    brand-new Aquamacs manual, and there is Richard
    Stallman's original Emacs manual. They can be searched (e.g. via
    Spotlight on OS X 10.4). We also provide direct access to the online configuration Wiki, which has been filling up with content nicely.  Please contribute; everybody has write access.
