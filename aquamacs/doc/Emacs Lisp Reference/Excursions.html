<h3 class="section">30.3 Excursions</h3>

<p><a name="index-excursion-2442"></a>
  It is often useful to move point &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; within a localized
portion of the program, or to switch buffers temporarily.  This is
called an <dfn>excursion</dfn>, and it is done with the <code>save-excursion</code>
special form.  This construct initially remembers the identity of the
current buffer, and its values of point and the mark, and restores them
after the completion of the excursion.

   <p>The forms for saving and restoring the configuration of windows are
described elsewhere (see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>, and see <a href="Frame-Configurations.html#Frame-Configurations">Frame Configurations</a>).  When only the identity of the current buffer needs
to be saved and restored, it is preferable to use
<code>save-current-buffer</code> instead.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>save-excursion</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-save_002dexcursion-2443"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-mark-excursion-2444"></a><a name="index-point-excursion-2445"></a>The <code>save-excursion</code> special form saves the identity of the current
buffer and the values of point and the mark in it, evaluates
<var>body</var>, and finally restores the buffer and its saved values of
point and the mark.  All three saved values are restored even in case of
an abnormal exit via <code>throw</code> or error (see <a href="Nonlocal-Exits.html#Nonlocal-Exits">Nonlocal Exits</a>).

        <p>The <code>save-excursion</code> special form is the standard way to move
point within one part of a program and avoid affecting the rest of the
program.  It is used more than 4000 times in the Lisp sources
of Emacs.

        <p><code>save-excursion</code> does not save the values of point and the mark for
other buffers, so changes in other buffers remain in effect after
<code>save-excursion</code> exits.

        <p><a name="index-window-excursions-2446"></a>Likewise, <code>save-excursion</code> does not restore window-buffer
correspondences altered by functions such as <code>switch-to-buffer</code>. 
One way to restore these correspondences, and the selected window, is to
use <code>save-window-excursion</code> inside <code>save-excursion</code>
(see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>).

        <p>The value returned by <code>save-excursion</code> is the result of the last
form in <var>body</var>, or <code>nil</code> if no body forms were given.

     <pre class="example">          (save-excursion <var>forms</var>)
          ==
          (let ((old-buf (current-buffer))
                (old-pnt (point-marker))
                (old-mark (copy-marker (mark-marker))))
            (unwind-protect
                (progn <var>forms</var>)
              (set-buffer old-buf)
              (goto-char old-pnt)
              (set-marker (mark-marker) old-mark)))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Ordinary insertion of text adjacent to the saved
point value relocates the saved value, just as it relocates all markers. 
More precisely, the saved value is a marker with insertion type
<code>nil</code>.  See <a href="Marker-Insertion-Types.html#Marker-Insertion-Types">Marker Insertion Types</a>.  Therefore, when the saved
point value is restored, it normally comes before the inserted text.

   <p>Although <code>save-excursion</code> saves the location of the mark, it does
not prevent functions which modify the buffer from setting
<code>deactivate-mark</code>, and thus causing the deactivation of the mark
after the command finishes.  See <a href="The-Mark.html#The-Mark">The Mark</a>.
