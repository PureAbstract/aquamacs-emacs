<h3 class="section">29.9 Input Focus</h3>

<p><a name="index-input-focus-2188"></a><!-- @cindex selected frame    Duplicates selected-frame -->

   <p>At any time, one frame in Emacs is the <dfn>selected frame</dfn>.  The selected
window always resides on the selected frame.

   <p>When Emacs displays its frames on several terminals (see <a href="Multiple-Displays.html#Multiple-Displays">Multiple Displays</a>), each terminal has its own selected frame.  But only one of
these is &ldquo;<em>the</em> selected frame&rdquo;: it's the frame that belongs to
the terminal from which the most recent input came.  That is, when Emacs
runs a command that came from a certain terminal, the selected frame is
the one of that terminal.  Since Emacs runs only a single command at any
given time, it needs to consider only one selected frame at a time; this
frame is what we call <dfn>the selected frame</dfn> in this manual.  The
display on which the selected frame is displayed is the <dfn>selected
frame's display</dfn>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>selected-frame</b><var><a name="index-selected_002dframe-2189"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the selected frame. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Some window systems and window managers direct keyboard input to the
window object that the mouse is in; others require explicit clicks or
commands to <dfn>shift the focus</dfn> to various window objects.  Either
way, Emacs automatically keeps track of which frame has the focus.  To
switch to a different frame from a Lisp function, call
<code>select-frame-set-input-focus</code>.

   <p>Lisp programs can also switch frames &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; by calling the
function <code>select-frame</code>.  This does not alter the window system's
concept of focus; rather, it escapes from the window manager's control
until that control is somehow reasserted.

   <p>When using a text-only terminal, only one frame can be displayed at a
time on the terminal, so after a call to <code>select-frame</code>, the next
redisplay actually displays the newly selected frame.  This frame
remains selected until a subsequent call to <code>select-frame</code> or
<code>select-frame-set-input-focus</code>.  Each terminal frame has a number
which appears in the mode line before the buffer name (see <a href="Mode-Line-Variables.html#Mode-Line-Variables">Mode Line Variables</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>select-frame-set-input-focus</b><var> frame<a name="index-select_002dframe_002dset_002dinput_002dfocus-2190"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>frame</var> the selected frame, raises it (should
it happen to be obscured by other frames) and tries to give it the X
server's focus.  On a text-only terminal, the next redisplay displays
the new frame on the entire terminal screen.  The return value of this
function is not significant. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<!-- ??? This is not yet implemented properly. -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>select-frame</b><var> frame<a name="index-select_002dframe-2191"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function selects frame <var>frame</var>, temporarily disregarding the
focus of the X server if any.  The selection of <var>frame</var> lasts until
the next time the user does something to select a different frame, or
until the next time this function is called.  (If you are using a
window system, the previously selected frame may be restored as the
selected frame after return to the command loop, because it still may
have the window system's input focus.)  The specified <var>frame</var>
becomes the selected frame, as explained above, and the terminal that
<var>frame</var> is on becomes the selected terminal.  This function
returns <var>frame</var>, or <code>nil</code> if <var>frame</var> has been deleted.

        <p>In general, you should never use <code>select-frame</code> in a way that could
switch to a different terminal without switching back when you're done. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Emacs cooperates with the window system by arranging to select frames as
the server and window manager request.  It does so by generating a
special kind of input event, called a <dfn>focus</dfn> event, when
appropriate.  The command loop handles a focus event by calling
<code>handle-switch-frame</code>.  See <a href="Focus-Events.html#Focus-Events">Focus Events</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>handle-switch-frame</b><var> frame<a name="index-handle_002dswitch_002dframe-2192"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function handles a focus event by selecting frame <var>frame</var>.

        <p>Focus events normally do their job by invoking this command. 
Don't call it for any other reason. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>redirect-frame-focus</b><var> frame &amp;optional focus-frame<a name="index-redirect_002dframe_002dfocus-2193"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function redirects focus from <var>frame</var> to <var>focus-frame</var>. 
This means that <var>focus-frame</var> will receive subsequent keystrokes and
events intended for <var>frame</var>.  After such an event, the value of
<code>last-event-frame</code> will be <var>focus-frame</var>.  Also, switch-frame
events specifying <var>frame</var> will instead select <var>focus-frame</var>.

        <p>If <var>focus-frame</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, that cancels any existing
redirection for <var>frame</var>, which therefore once again receives its own
events.

        <p>One use of focus redirection is for frames that don't have minibuffers. 
These frames use minibuffers on other frames.  Activating a minibuffer
on another frame redirects focus to that frame.  This puts the focus on
the minibuffer's frame, where it belongs, even though the mouse remains
in the frame that activated the minibuffer.

        <p>Selecting a frame can also change focus redirections.  Selecting frame
<code>bar</code>, when <code>foo</code> had been selected, changes any redirections
pointing to <code>foo</code> so that they point to <code>bar</code> instead.  This
allows focus redirection to work properly when the user switches from
one frame to another using <code>select-window</code>.

        <p>This means that a frame whose focus is redirected to itself is treated
differently from a frame whose focus is not redirected. 
<code>select-frame</code> affects the former but not the latter.

        <p>The redirection lasts until <code>redirect-frame-focus</code> is called to
change it. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>focus-follows-mouse</b><var><a name="index-focus_002dfollows_002dmouse-2194"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This option is how you inform Emacs whether the window manager transfers
focus when the user moves the mouse.  Non-<code>nil</code> says that it does. 
When this is so, the command <code>other-frame</code> moves the mouse to a
position consistent with the new selected frame.  (This option has no
effect on MS-Windows, where the mouse pointer is always automatically
moved by the OS to the selected frame.)
