<h3 class="section">15.10 Hooks for Loading</h3>

<p><a name="index-loading-hooks-835"></a><a name="index-hooks-for-loading-836"></a>
You can ask for code to be executed each time Emacs loads a library,
by using the variable <code>after-load-functions</code>:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>after-load-functions</b><var><a name="index-after_002dload_002dfunctions-837"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This abnormal hook is run after loading a file.  Each function in the
hook is called with a single argument, the absolute filename of the
file that was just loaded. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If you want code to be executed when a <em>particular</em> library is
loaded, use the function <code>eval-after-load</code>:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>eval-after-load</b><var> library form<a name="index-eval_002dafter_002dload-838"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function arranges to evaluate <var>form</var> at the end of loading
the file <var>library</var>, each time <var>library</var> is loaded.  If
<var>library</var> is already loaded, it evaluates <var>form</var> right away. 
Don't forget to quote <var>form</var>!

        <p>You don't need to give a directory or extension in the file name
<var>library</var>.  Normally, you just give a bare file name, like this:

     <pre class="example">          (eval-after-load "edebug" '(def-edebug-spec c-point t))
</pre>
        <p>To restrict which files can trigger the evaluation, include a
directory or an extension or both in <var>library</var>.  Only a file whose
absolute true name (i.e., the name with all symbolic links chased out)
matches all the given name components will match.  In the following
example, <samp><span class="file">my_inst.elc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">my_inst.elc.gz</span></samp> in some directory
<code>..../foo/bar</code> will trigger the evaluation, but not
<samp><span class="file">my_inst.el</span></samp>:

     <pre class="example">          (eval-after-load "foo/bar/my_inst.elc" ...)
</pre>
        <p><var>library</var> can also be a feature (i.e. a symbol), in which case
<var>form</var> is evaluated when <code>(provide </code><var>library</var><code>)</code> is called.

        <p>An error in <var>form</var> does not undo the load, but does prevent
execution of the rest of <var>form</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Normally, well-designed Lisp programs should not use
<code>eval-after-load</code>.  If you need to examine and set the variables
defined in another library (those meant for outside use), you can do
it immediately&mdash;there is no need to wait until the library is loaded. 
If you need to call functions defined by that library, you should load
the library, preferably with <code>require</code> (see <a href="Named-Features.html#Named-Features">Named Features</a>).

   <p>But it is OK to use <code>eval-after-load</code> in your personal
customizations if you don't feel that they must meet the design
standards for programs meant for wider use.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>after-load-alist</b><var><a name="index-after_002dload_002dalist-839"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable stores an alist built by <code>eval-after-load</code>,
containing the expressions to evaluate when certain libraries are
loaded.  Each element looks like this:

     <pre class="example">          (<var>regexp-or-feature</var> <var>forms</var>...)
</pre>
        <p>The key <var>regexp-or-feature</var> is either a regular expression or a
symbol, and the value is a list of forms.  The forms are evaluated
when the key matches the absolute true name or feature name of the
library being loaded. 
</p></blockquote></div>
