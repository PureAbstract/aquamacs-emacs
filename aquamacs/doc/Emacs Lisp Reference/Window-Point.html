<h3 class="section">28.9 Windows and Point</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-position-2042"></a><a name="index-window-point-2043"></a><a name="index-position-in-window-2044"></a><a name="index-point-in-window-2045"></a>
  Each window has its own value of point, independent of the value of
point in other windows displaying the same buffer.  This makes it useful
to have multiple windows showing one buffer.

     <ul>
<li>The window point is established when a window is first created; it is
initialized from the buffer's point, or from the window point of another
window opened on the buffer if such a window exists.

     <li>Selecting a window sets the value of point in its buffer from the
window's value of point.  Conversely, deselecting a window sets the
window's value of point from that of the buffer.  Thus, when you switch
between windows that display a given buffer, the point value for the
selected window is in effect in the buffer, while the point values for
the other windows are stored in those windows.

     <li>As long as the selected window displays the current buffer, the window's
point and the buffer's point always move together; they remain equal. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">See <a href="Positions.html#Positions">Positions</a>, for more details on buffer positions.

   <p><a name="index-cursor-2046"></a>  As far as the user is concerned, point is where the cursor is, and
when the user switches to another buffer, the cursor jumps to the
position of point in that buffer.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-point</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002dpoint-2047"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the current position of point in <var>window</var>. 
For a nonselected window, this is the value point would have (in that
window's buffer) if that window were selected.  If <var>window</var> is
<code>nil</code>, the selected window is used.

        <p>When <var>window</var> is the selected window and its buffer is also the
current buffer, the value returned is the same as point in that buffer.

        <p>Strictly speaking, it would be more correct to return the
&ldquo;top-level&rdquo; value of point, outside of any <code>save-excursion</code>
forms.  But that value is hard to find. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-window-point</b><var> window position<a name="index-set_002dwindow_002dpoint-2048"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function positions point in <var>window</var> at position
<var>position</var> in <var>window</var>'s buffer.  It returns <var>position</var>.

        <p>If <var>window</var> is selected, and its buffer is current,
this simply does <code>goto-char</code>.
