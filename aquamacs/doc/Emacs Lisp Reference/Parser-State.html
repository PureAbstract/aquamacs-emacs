<h4 class="subsection">35.6.3 Parser State</h4>

<p><a name="index-parser-state-3091"></a>
  A <dfn>parser state</dfn> is a list of ten elements describing the final
state of parsing text syntactically as part of an expression.  The
parsing functions in the following sections return a parser state as
the value, and in some cases accept one as an argument also, so that
you can resume parsing after it stops.  Here are the meanings of the
elements of the parser state:

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>The depth in parentheses, counting from 0.  <strong>Warning:</strong> this can
be negative if there are more close parens than open parens between
the start of the defun and point.

     <li><a name="index-innermost-containing-parentheses-3092"></a>The character position of the start of the innermost parenthetical
grouping containing the stopping point; <code>nil</code> if none.

     <li><a name="index-previous-complete-subexpression-3093"></a>The character position of the start of the last complete subexpression
terminated; <code>nil</code> if none.

     <li><a name="index-inside-string-3094"></a>Non-<code>nil</code> if inside a string.  More precisely, this is the
character that will terminate the string, or <code>t</code> if a generic
string delimiter character should terminate it.

     <li><a name="index-inside-comment-3095"></a><code>t</code> if inside a comment (of either style),
or the comment nesting level if inside a kind of comment
that can be nested.

     <li><a name="index-quote-character-3096"></a><code>t</code> if point is just after a quote character.

     <li>The minimum parenthesis depth encountered during this scan.

     <li>What kind of comment is active: <code>nil</code> for a comment of style
&ldquo;a&rdquo; or when not inside a comment, <code>t</code> for a comment of style
&ldquo;b,&rdquo; and <code>syntax-table</code> for a comment that should be ended by a
generic comment delimiter character.

     <li>The string or comment start position.  While inside a comment, this is
the position where the comment began; while inside a string, this is the
position where the string began.  When outside of strings and comments,
this element is <code>nil</code>.

     <li>Internal data for continuing the parsing.  The meaning of this
data is subject to change; it is used if you pass this list
as the <var>state</var> argument to another call.
        </ol>

   <p>Elements 1, 2, and 6 are ignored in a state which you pass as an
argument to continue parsing, and elements 8 and 9 are used only in
trivial cases.  Those elements serve primarily to convey information
to the Lisp program which does the parsing.

   <p>One additional piece of useful information is available from a
parser state using this function:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>syntax-ppss-toplevel-pos</b><var> state<a name="index-syntax_002dppss_002dtoplevel_002dpos-3097"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function extracts, from parser state <var>state</var>, the last
position scanned in the parse which was at top level in grammatical
structure.  &ldquo;At top level&rdquo; means outside of any parentheses,
comments, or strings.

        <p>The value is <code>nil</code> if <var>state</var> represents a parse which has
arrived at a top level position. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>We have provided this access function rather than document how the
data is represented in the state, because we plan to change the
representation in the future.
