<h3 class="section">1.1 Caveats</h3>

<p><a name="index-bugs-in-this-manual-1"></a>
  This manual has gone through numerous drafts.  It is nearly complete
but not flawless.  There are a few topics that are not covered, either
because we consider them secondary (such as most of the individual
modes) or because they are yet to be written.  Because we are not able
to deal with them completely, we have left out several parts
intentionally.  This includes most information about usage on VMS.

   <p>The manual should be fully correct in what it does cover, and it is
therefore open to criticism on anything it says&mdash;from specific examples
and descriptive text, to the ordering of chapters and sections.  If
something is confusing, or you find that you have to look at the sources
or experiment to learn something not covered in the manual, then perhaps
the manual should be fixed.  Please let us know.

   <p>As you use this manual, we ask that you send corrections as soon as you
find them.  If you think of a simple, real life example for a function
or group of functions, please make an effort to write it up and send it
in.  Please reference any comments to the node name and function or
variable name, as appropriate.  Also state the number of the edition
you are criticizing.

   <p><a name="index-bugs-2"></a><a name="index-suggestions-3"></a>Please mail comments and corrections to

<pre class="example">     bug-lisp-manual@gnu.org
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">We let mail to this list accumulate unread until someone decides to
apply the corrections.  Months, and sometimes years, go by between
updates.  So please attach no significance to the lack of a reply&mdash;your
mail <em>will</em> be acted on in due time.  If you want to contact the
Emacs maintainers more quickly, send mail to
<code>bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</code>.
