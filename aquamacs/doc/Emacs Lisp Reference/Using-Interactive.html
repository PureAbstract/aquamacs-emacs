<h4 class="subsection">21.2.1 Using <code>interactive</code></h4>

<p><a name="index-arguments_002c-interactive-entry-1166"></a>
  This section describes how to write the <code>interactive</code> form that
makes a Lisp function an interactively-callable command, and how to
examine a command's <code>interactive</code> form.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>interactive</b><var> arg-descriptor<a name="index-interactive-1167"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form declares that the function in which it appears is a
command, and that it may therefore be called interactively (via
<kbd>M-x</kbd> or by entering a key sequence bound to it).  The argument
<var>arg-descriptor</var> declares how to compute the arguments to the
command when the command is called interactively.

        <p>A command may be called from Lisp programs like any other function, but
then the caller supplies the arguments and <var>arg-descriptor</var> has no
effect.

        <p>The <code>interactive</code> form has its effect because the command loop
(actually, its subroutine <code>call-interactively</code>) scans through the
function definition looking for it, before calling the function.  Once
the function is called, all its body forms including the
<code>interactive</code> form are executed, but at this time
<code>interactive</code> simply returns <code>nil</code> without even evaluating its
argument. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>There are three possibilities for the argument <var>arg-descriptor</var>:

     <ul>
<li>It may be omitted or <code>nil</code>; then the command is called with no
arguments.  This leads quickly to an error if the command requires one
or more arguments.

     <li>It may be a string; then its contents should consist of a code character
followed by a prompt (which some code characters use and some ignore). 
The prompt ends either with the end of the string or with a newline. 
Here is a simple example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (interactive "bFrobnicate buffer: ")
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">The code letter `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>' says to read the name of an existing buffer,
with completion.  The buffer name is the sole argument passed to the
command.  The rest of the string is a prompt.

     <p>If there is a newline character in the string, it terminates the prompt. 
If the string does not end there, then the rest of the string should
contain another code character and prompt, specifying another argument. 
You can specify any number of arguments in this way.

     <!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
<p>The prompt string can use `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>' to include previous argument values
(starting with the first argument) in the prompt.  This is done using
<code>format</code> (see <a href="Formatting-Strings.html#Formatting-Strings">Formatting Strings</a>).  For example, here is how
you could read the name of an existing buffer followed by a new name to
give to that buffer:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (interactive "bBuffer to rename: \nsRename buffer %s to: ")
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_002a_007d-in-_0040code_007binteractive_007d-1168"></a><a name="index-read_002donly-buffers-in-interactive-1169"></a>If the first character in the string is `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', then an error is
signaled if the buffer is read-only.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0040_0040_007d-in-_0040code_007binteractive_007d-1170"></a><!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
If the first character in the string is `<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>', and if the key
sequence used to invoke the command includes any mouse events, then
the window associated with the first of those events is selected
before the command is run.

     <p>You can use `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>' together; the order does not matter. 
Actual reading of arguments is controlled by the rest of the prompt
string (starting with the first character that is not `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>').

     <li>It may be a Lisp expression that is not a string; then it should be a
form that is evaluated to get a list of arguments to pass to the
command.  Usually this form will call various functions to read input
from the user, most often through the minibuffer (see <a href="Minibuffers.html#Minibuffers">Minibuffers</a>)
or directly from the keyboard (see <a href="Reading-Input.html#Reading-Input">Reading Input</a>).

     <p>Providing point or the mark as an argument value is also common, but
if you do this <em>and</em> read input (whether using the minibuffer or
not), be sure to get the integer values of point or the mark after
reading.  The current buffer may be receiving subprocess output; if
subprocess output arrives while the command is waiting for input, it
could relocate point and the mark.

     <p>Here's an example of what <em>not</em> to do:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (interactive
           (list (region-beginning) (region-end)
                 (read-string "Foo: " nil 'my-history)))
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Here's how to avoid the problem, by examining point and the mark after
reading the keyboard input:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (interactive
           (let ((string (read-string "Foo: " nil 'my-history)))
             (list (region-beginning) (region-end) string)))
     </pre>
     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the argument values should not include any data
types that can't be printed and then read.  Some facilities save
<code>command-history</code> in a file to be read in the subsequent
sessions; if a command's arguments contain a data type that prints
using `<samp><span class="samp">#&lt;...&gt;</span></samp>' syntax, those facilities won't work.

     <p>There are, however, a few exceptions: it is ok to use a limited set of
expressions such as <code>(point)</code>, <code>(mark)</code>,
<code>(region-beginning)</code>, and <code>(region-end)</code>, because Emacs
recognizes them specially and puts the expression (rather than its
value) into the command history.  To see whether the expression you
wrote is one of these exceptions, run the command, then examine
<code>(car command-history)</code>.
