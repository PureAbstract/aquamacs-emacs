<h3 class="section">32.9 Undo</h3>

<p><a name="index-redo-2568"></a>
  Most buffers have an <dfn>undo list</dfn>, which records all changes made
to the buffer's text so that they can be undone.  (The buffers that
don't have one are usually special-purpose buffers for which Emacs
assumes that undoing is not useful.  In particular, any buffer whose
name begins with a space has its undo recording off by default;
see <a href="Buffer-Names.html#Buffer-Names">Buffer Names</a>.)  All the primitives that modify the
text in the buffer automatically add elements to the front of the undo
list, which is in the variable <code>buffer-undo-list</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>buffer-undo-list</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dundo_002dlist-2569"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This buffer-local variable's value is the undo list of the current
buffer. A value of <code>t</code> disables the recording of undo information. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here are the kinds of elements an undo list can have:

     <dl>
<dt><var>position</var><dd>This kind of element records a previous value of point; undoing this
element moves point to <var>position</var>.  Ordinary cursor motion does not
make any sort of undo record, but deletion operations use these entries
to record where point was before the command.

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>beg</var><code> . </code><var>end</var><code>)</code><dd>This kind of element indicates how to delete text that was inserted. 
Upon insertion, the text occupied the range <var>beg</var>&ndash;<var>end</var> in the
buffer.

     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>text</var><code> . </code><var>position</var><code>)</code><dd>This kind of element indicates how to reinsert text that was deleted. 
The deleted text itself is the string <var>text</var>.  The place to
reinsert it is <code>(abs </code><var>position</var><code>)</code>.  If <var>position</var> is
positive, point was at the beginning of the deleted text, otherwise it
was at the end.

     <br><dt><code>(t </code><var>high</var><code> . </code><var>low</var><code>)</code><dd>This kind of element indicates that an unmodified buffer became
modified.  The elements <var>high</var> and <var>low</var> are two integers, each
recording 16 bits of the visited file's modification time as of when it
was previously visited or saved.  <code>primitive-undo</code> uses those
values to determine whether to mark the buffer as unmodified once again;
it does so only if the file's modification time matches those numbers.

     <br><dt><code>(nil </code><var>property</var> <var>value</var> <var>beg</var><code> . </code><var>end</var><code>)</code><dd>This kind of element records a change in a text property. 
Here's how you might undo the change:

     <pre class="example">          (put-text-property <var>beg</var> <var>end</var> <var>property</var> <var>value</var>)
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>(</code><var>marker</var><code> . </code><var>adjustment</var><code>)</code><dd>This kind of element records the fact that the marker <var>marker</var> was
relocated due to deletion of surrounding text, and that it moved
<var>adjustment</var> character positions.  Undoing this element moves
<var>marker</var> &minus; <var>adjustment</var> characters.

     <br><dt><code>(apply </code><var>funname</var><code> . </code><var>args</var><code>)</code><dd>This is an extensible undo item, which is undone by calling
<var>funname</var> with arguments <var>args</var>.

     <br><dt><code>(apply </code><var>delta</var> <var>beg</var> <var>end</var> <var>funname</var><code> . </code><var>args</var><code>)</code><dd>This is an extensible undo item, which records a change limited to the
range <var>beg</var> to <var>end</var>, which increased the size of the buffer
by <var>delta</var>.  It is undone by calling <var>funname</var> with arguments
<var>args</var>.

     <p>This kind of element enables undo limited to a region to determine
whether the element pertains to that region.

     <br><dt><code>nil</code><dd>This element is a boundary.  The elements between two boundaries are
called a <dfn>change group</dfn>; normally, each change group corresponds to
one keyboard command, and undo commands normally undo an entire group as
a unit. 
</dl>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>undo-boundary</b><var><a name="index-undo_002dboundary-2570"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function places a boundary element in the undo list.  The undo
command stops at such a boundary, and successive undo commands undo
to earlier and earlier boundaries.  This function returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p>The editor command loop automatically creates an undo boundary before
each key sequence is executed.  Thus, each undo normally undoes the
effects of one command.  Self-inserting input characters are an
exception.  The command loop makes a boundary for the first such
character; the next 19 consecutive self-inserting input characters do
not make boundaries, and then the 20th does, and so on as long as
self-inserting characters continue.

        <p>All buffer modifications add a boundary whenever the previous undoable
change was made in some other buffer.  This is to ensure that
each command makes a boundary in each buffer where it makes changes.

        <p>Calling this function explicitly is useful for splitting the effects of
a command into more than one unit.  For example, <code>query-replace</code>
calls <code>undo-boundary</code> after each replacement, so that the user can
undo individual replacements one by one. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>undo-in-progress</b><var><a name="index-undo_002din_002dprogress-2571"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is normally <code>nil</code>, but the undo commands bind it to
<code>t</code>.  This is so that various kinds of change hooks can tell when
they're being called for the sake of undoing. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>primitive-undo</b><var> count list<a name="index-primitive_002dundo-2572"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is the basic function for undoing elements of an undo list. 
It undoes the first <var>count</var> elements of <var>list</var>, returning
the rest of <var>list</var>.

        <p><code>primitive-undo</code> adds elements to the buffer's undo list when it
changes the buffer.  Undo commands avoid confusion by saving the undo
list value at the beginning of a sequence of undo operations.  Then the
undo operations use and update the saved value.  The new elements added
by undoing are not part of this saved value, so they don't interfere with
continuing to undo.

        <p>This function does not bind <code>undo-in-progress</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>
