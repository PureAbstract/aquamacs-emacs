<h3 class="section">28.9 Dedicated Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-dedicated-window-2112"></a>
Functions for displaying a buffer can be told to not use specific
windows by marking these windows as <dfn>dedicated</dfn> to their buffers. 
<code>display-buffer</code> (see <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>) never uses a dedicated
window for displaying another buffer in it.  <code>get-lru-window</code> and
<code>get-largest-window</code> (see <a href="Selecting-Windows.html#Selecting-Windows">Selecting Windows</a>) do not consider
dedicated windows as candidates when their <var>dedicated</var> argument is
non-<code>nil</code>.  The behavior of <code>set-window-buffer</code>
(see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>) with respect to dedicated windows is
slightly different, see below.

   <p>When <code>delete-windows-on</code> (see <a href="Deleting-Windows.html#Deleting-Windows">Deleting Windows</a>) wants to delete
a dedicated window and that window is the only window on its frame, it
deletes the window's frame too, provided there are other frames left. 
<code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code> (see <a href="Displaying-Buffers.html#Displaying-Buffers">Displaying Buffers</a>) tries to
delete all dedicated windows showing its buffer argument.  When such a
window is the only window on its frame, that frame is deleted, provided
there are other frames left.  If there are no more frames left, some
other buffer is displayed in the window, and the window is marked as
non-dedicated.

   <p>When you kill a buffer (see <a href="Killing-Buffers.html#Killing-Buffers">Killing Buffers</a>) displayed in a
dedicated window, any such window usually gets deleted too, since
<code>kill-buffer</code> calls <code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code> for cleaning
up windows.  Burying a buffer (see <a href="The-Buffer-List.html#The-Buffer-List">The Buffer List</a>) deletes the
selected window if it is dedicated to that buffer.  If, however, that
window is the only window on its frame, <code>bury-buffer</code> displays
another buffer in it and iconifies the frame.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-dedicated-p</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-window_002ddedicated_002dp-2113"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns non-<code>nil</code> if <var>window</var> is dedicated to its
buffer and <code>nil</code> otherwise.  More precisely, the return value is
the value assigned by the last call of <code>set-window-dedicated-p</code> for
<var>window</var> or <code>nil</code> if that function was never called with
<var>window</var> as its argument.  The default for <var>window</var> is the
selected window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-window-dedicated-p</b><var> window flag<a name="index-set_002dwindow_002ddedicated_002dp-2114"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function marks <var>window</var> as dedicated to its buffer if
<var>flag</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, and non-dedicated otherwise.

        <p>As a special case, if <var>flag</var> is <code>t</code>, <var>window</var> becomes
<dfn>strongly</dfn> dedicated to its buffer.  <code>set-window-buffer</code>
signals an error when the window it acts upon is strongly dedicated to
its buffer and does not already display the buffer it is asked to
display.  Other functions do not treat <code>t</code> differently from any
non-<code>nil</code> value.
