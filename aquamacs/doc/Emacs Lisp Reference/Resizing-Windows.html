<h3 class="section">28.15 Changing the Size of a Window</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-resizing-2090"></a><a name="index-resize-window-2091"></a><a name="index-changing-window-size-2092"></a><a name="index-window-size_002c-changing-2093"></a>
  The window size functions fall into two classes: high-level commands
that change the size of windows and low-level functions that access
window size.  Emacs does not permit overlapping windows or gaps between
windows, so resizing one window affects other windows.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>enlarge-window</b><var> size &amp;optional horizontal<a name="index-enlarge_002dwindow-2094"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the selected window <var>size</var> lines taller,
stealing lines from neighboring windows.  It takes the lines from one
window at a time until that window is used up, then takes from another. 
If a window from which lines are stolen shrinks below
<code>window-min-height</code> lines, that window disappears.

        <p>If <var>horizontal</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function makes
<var>window</var> wider by <var>size</var> columns, stealing columns instead of
lines.  If a window from which columns are stolen shrinks below
<code>window-min-width</code> columns, that window disappears.

        <p>If the requested size would exceed that of the window's frame, then the
function makes the window occupy the entire height (or width) of the
frame.

        <p>If there are various other windows from which lines or columns can be
stolen, and some of them specify fixed size (using
<code>window-size-fixed</code>, see below), they are left untouched while
other windows are &ldquo;robbed.&rdquo;  If it would be necessary to alter the
size of a fixed-size window, <code>enlarge-window</code> gets an error
instead.

        <p>If <var>size</var> is negative, this function shrinks the window by
&minus;<var>size</var> lines or columns.  If that makes the window smaller
than the minimum size (<code>window-min-height</code> and
<code>window-min-width</code>), <code>enlarge-window</code> deletes the window.

        <p><code>enlarge-window</code> returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>enlarge-window-horizontally</b><var> columns<a name="index-enlarge_002dwindow_002dhorizontally-2095"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the selected window <var>columns</var> wider. 
It could be defined as follows:

     <pre class="example">          (defun enlarge-window-horizontally (columns)
            (interactive "p")
            (enlarge-window columns t))
     </pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>shrink-window</b><var> size &amp;optional horizontal<a name="index-shrink_002dwindow-2096"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is like <code>enlarge-window</code> but negates the argument
<var>size</var>, making the selected window smaller by giving lines (or
columns) to the other windows.  If the window shrinks below
<code>window-min-height</code> or <code>window-min-width</code>, then it disappears.

        <p>If <var>size</var> is negative, the window is enlarged by &minus;<var>size</var>
lines or columns. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>shrink-window-horizontally</b><var> columns<a name="index-shrink_002dwindow_002dhorizontally-2097"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the selected window <var>columns</var> narrower. 
It could be defined as follows:

     <pre class="example">          (defun shrink-window-horizontally (columns)
            (interactive "p")
            (shrink-window columns t))
     </pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>adjust-window-trailing-edge</b><var> window delta horizontal<a name="index-adjust_002dwindow_002dtrailing_002dedge-2098"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the selected window <var>delta</var> lines taller or
<var>delta</var> columns wider, by moving the bottom or right edge.  This
function does not delete other windows; if it cannot make the
requested size adjustment, it signals an error.  On success, this
function returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>fit-window-to-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional window max-height min-height<a name="index-fit_002dwindow_002dto_002dbuffer-2099"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the right height to display its
contents exactly.  If <var>window</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it uses
the selected window.

        <p>The argument <var>max-height</var> specifies the maximum height the window
is allowed to be; <code>nil</code> means use the frame height.  The argument
<var>min-height</var> specifies the minimum height for the window;
<code>nil</code> means use <code>window-min-height</code>.  All these height
values include the mode-line and/or header-line. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-shrink_002dwindow_002dif_002dlarger_002dthan_002dbuffer-2100"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command shrinks <var>window</var> vertically to be as small as
possible while still showing the full contents of its buffer&mdash;but not
less than <code>window-min-height</code> lines.  If <var>window</var> is not
given, it defaults to the selected window.

        <p>However, the command does nothing if the window is already too small to
display the whole text of the buffer, or if part of the contents are
currently scrolled off screen, or if the window is not the full width of
its frame, or if the window is the only window in its frame.

        <p>This command returns non-<code>nil</code> if it actually shrank the window
and <code>nil</code> otherwise. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>window-size-fixed</b><var><a name="index-window_002dsize_002dfixed-2101"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, in any given buffer,
then the size of any window displaying the buffer remains fixed
unless you explicitly change it or Emacs has no other choice.

        <p>If the value is <code>height</code>, then only the window's height is fixed;
if the value is <code>width</code>, then only the window's width is fixed. 
Any other non-<code>nil</code> value fixes both the width and the height.

        <p>This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set.

        <p>Explicit size-change functions such as <code>enlarge-window</code>
get an error if they would have to change a window size which is fixed. 
Therefore, when you want to change the size of such a window,
you should bind <code>window-size-fixed</code> to <code>nil</code>, like this:

     <pre class="example">          (let ((window-size-fixed nil))
             (enlarge-window 10))
     </pre>
        <p>Note that changing the frame size will change the size of a
fixed-size window, if there is no other alternative. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-minimum-window-size-2102"></a>  The following two variables constrain the window-structure-changing
functions to a minimum height and width.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>window-min-height</b><var><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dheight-2103"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable determines how short a window may become
before it is automatically deleted.  Making a window smaller than
<code>window-min-height</code> automatically deletes it, and no window may
be created shorter than this.  The default value is 4.

        <p>The absolute minimum window height is one; actions that change window
sizes reset this variable to one if it is less than one. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>window-min-width</b><var><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dwidth-2104"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable determines how narrow a window may become
before it is automatically deleted.  Making a window smaller than
<code>window-min-width</code> automatically deletes it, and no window may be
created narrower than this.  The default value is 10.

        <p>The absolute minimum window width is two; actions that change window
sizes reset this variable to two if it is less than two. 
</p></blockquote></div>
