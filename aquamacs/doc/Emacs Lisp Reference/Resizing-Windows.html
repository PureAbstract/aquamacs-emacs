<h3 class="section">28.16 Changing the Size of a Window</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-resizing-2168"></a><a name="index-resize-window-2169"></a><a name="index-changing-window-size-2170"></a><a name="index-window-size_002c-changing-2171"></a>
   The window size functions fall into two classes: high-level commands
that change the size of windows and low-level functions that access
window size.  Emacs does not permit overlapping windows or gaps between
windows, so resizing a window always affects at least one other window.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>enlarge-window</b><var> size &amp;optional horizontal<a name="index-enlarge_002dwindow-2172"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the selected window <var>size</var> lines taller by
stealing lines from windows above or below.  In a first round, it takes
lines from one window at a time until that window is
<code>window-min-height</code> lines tall, then takes from another.  If, at
the end of the first round, the selected window is still not tall
enough, <code>enlarge-window</code> starts a second round, where it deletes
windows above or below the selected one.

        <p>If <var>horizontal</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function makes the window
<var>size</var> columns wider, stealing columns instead of lines.  If a
window from which columns are stolen shrinks below
<code>window-min-width</code> columns, that window disappears.

        <p>If the requested size would exceed that of the window's frame, then the
function makes the window occupy the entire height (or width) of the
frame.

        <p>If there are various other windows from which lines or columns can be
stolen, and some of them specify fixed size (using
<code>window-size-fixed</code>, see below), they are left untouched while
other windows are &ldquo;robbed.&rdquo;  If it would be necessary to alter the
size of a fixed-size window, <code>enlarge-window</code> gets an error
instead.

        <p>If <var>size</var> is negative, this function shrinks the selected window by
&minus;<var>size</var> lines or columns.  If that makes the window smaller
than the minimum size (<code>window-min-height</code> and
<code>window-min-width</code>), then <code>enlarge-window</code> deletes the window.

        <p><code>enlarge-window</code> returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>enlarge-window-horizontally</b><var> columns<a name="index-enlarge_002dwindow_002dhorizontally-2173"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the selected window <var>columns</var> wider. 
It could be defined as follows:

     <pre class="example">          (defun enlarge-window-horizontally (columns)
            (interactive "p")
            (enlarge-window columns t))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>shrink-window</b><var> size &amp;optional horizontal<a name="index-shrink_002dwindow-2174"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is like <code>enlarge-window</code> but negates the argument
<var>size</var>, making the selected window smaller by giving lines (or
columns) to the other windows.  If the window shrinks below
<code>window-min-height</code> or <code>window-min-width</code>, then it disappears.

        <p>If <var>size</var> is negative, the window is enlarged by &minus;<var>size</var>
lines or columns. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>shrink-window-horizontally</b><var> columns<a name="index-shrink_002dwindow_002dhorizontally-2175"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the selected window <var>columns</var> narrower. 
It could be defined as follows:

     <pre class="example">          (defun shrink-window-horizontally (columns)
            (interactive "p")
            (shrink-window columns t))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>adjust-window-trailing-edge</b><var> window delta horizontal<a name="index-adjust_002dwindow_002dtrailing_002dedge-2176"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function makes the selected window <var>delta</var> lines taller or
<var>delta</var> columns wider, by moving the bottom or right edge.  This
function does not delete other windows; if it cannot make the
requested size adjustment, it signals an error.  On success, this
function returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>fit-window-to-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional window max-height min-height<a name="index-fit_002dwindow_002dto_002dbuffer-2177"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command makes <var>window</var> the right height to display its
contents exactly.  The default for <var>window</var> is the selected window.

        <p>The optional argument <var>max-height</var> specifies the maximum height the
window is allowed to be; <code>nil</code> means use the maximum permissible
height of a window on <var>window</var>'s frame.  The optional argument
<var>min-height</var> specifies the minimum height for the window; <code>nil</code>
means use <code>window-min-height</code>.  All these height values include the
mode line and/or header line.

        <p>This function can delete windows when their height shrinks below
<var>min-height</var>.  It returns non-<code>nil</code> if it orderly resized
<var>window</var>, and <code>nil</code> otherwise. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-shrink_002dwindow_002dif_002dlarger_002dthan_002dbuffer-2178"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command shrinks <var>window</var> vertically to be as small as possible
while still showing the full contents of its buffer&mdash;but not less than
<code>window-min-height</code> lines.  The default for <var>window</var> is
the selected window.

        <p>However, this command does nothing if the window is already too small to
display the whole text of the buffer, or if part of the contents are
currently scrolled off screen, or if the window is not the full width of
its frame, or if the window is the only window in its frame.

        <p>This command returns non-<code>nil</code> if it actually shrank the window
and <code>nil</code> otherwise. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-fixed_002dsize-window-2179"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>window-size-fixed</b><var><a name="index-window_002dsize_002dfixed-2180"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, in a given buffer, then the size of
any window displaying that buffer remains fixed unless you either
explicitly change it or Emacs has no other choice.

        <p>If the value is <code>height</code>, then only the window's height is fixed;
if the value is <code>width</code>, then only the window's width is fixed. 
Any other non-<code>nil</code> value fixes both the width and the height.

        <p>This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set.

        <p>Explicit size-change functions such as <code>enlarge-window</code>
get an error if they would have to change a window size which is fixed. 
Therefore, when you want to change the size of such a window,
you should bind <code>window-size-fixed</code> to <code>nil</code>, like this:

     <pre class="example">          (let ((window-size-fixed nil))
             (enlarge-window 10))
</pre>
        <p>Deleting an adjacent window or changing the frame size may change the
size of a fixed-size window, if there is no other alternative. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-minimum-window-size-2181"></a>  The following two variables constrain the window-structure-changing
functions to a minimum height and width.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>window-min-height</b><var><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dheight-2182"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable specifies how short a window may become
before it is automatically deleted.  Making a window smaller than
<code>window-min-height</code> automatically deletes it, and no window may be
created shorter than this.  The value is measured in line units.  When
the window wants a mode line and/or a header line, they are counted as
one line each.  The default value is <code>4</code>.  A value less than
<code>1</code> is ignored. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>window-min-width</b><var><a name="index-window_002dmin_002dwidth-2183"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable specifies how narrow a window may become
before it is automatically deleted.  Making a window smaller than
<code>window-min-width</code> automatically deletes it, and no window may be
created narrower than this.  The value is measured in characters and
includes any fringes or the scroll bar.  The default value is <code>10</code>. 
A value less than <code>2</code> is ignored. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-balancing-window-sizes-2184"></a>Emacs provides two functions to balance windows, that is, to even out
the sizes of windows on the same frame.  The minibuffer window and
fixed-size windows are not resized by these functions.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>balance-windows</b><var> &amp;optional window-or-frame<a name="index-balance_002dwindows-2185"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function balances windows in a way that gives more space to
full-width and/or full-height windows.  If <var>window-or-frame</var>
specifies a frame, it balances all windows on that frame.  If
<var>window-or-frame</var> specifies a window, it balances this window and
its &ldquo;siblings&rdquo; only.  Think of a sibling as the other (original or
new) window with respect to the present one, involved in the process of
splitting; see <a href="Splitting-Windows.html#Splitting-Windows">Splitting Windows</a>.  Since a sibling may have been
split again, a window can have more than one sibling. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>balance-windows-area</b><var><a name="index-balance_002dwindows_002darea-2186"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function attempts to give all windows on the selected frame
approximately the same share of the screen area.  This means that
full-width or full-height windows are not given more space than other
windows. 
</p></blockquote></div>
