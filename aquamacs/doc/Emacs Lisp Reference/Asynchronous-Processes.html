<h3 class="section">37.4 Creating an Asynchronous Process</h3>

<p><a name="index-asynchronous-subprocess-3200"></a>
  After an <dfn>asynchronous process</dfn> is created, Emacs and the subprocess
both continue running immediately.  The process thereafter runs
in parallel with Emacs, and the two can communicate with each other
using the functions described in the following sections.  However,
communication is only partially asynchronous: Emacs sends data to the
process only when certain functions are called, and Emacs accepts data
from the process only when Emacs is waiting for input or for a time
delay.

   <p>Here we describe how to create an asynchronous process.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>start-process</b><var> name buffer-or-name program &amp;rest args<a name="index-start_002dprocess-3201"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function creates a new asynchronous subprocess and starts the
program <var>program</var> running in it.  It returns a process object that
stands for the new subprocess in Lisp.  The argument <var>name</var>
specifies the name for the process object; if a process with this name
already exists, then <var>name</var> is modified (by appending &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;1&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;,
etc.) to be unique.  The buffer <var>buffer-or-name</var> is the buffer to
associate with the process.

        <p>The remaining arguments, <var>args</var>, are strings that specify command
line arguments for the program.

        <p>In the example below, the first process is started and runs (rather,
sleeps) for 100 seconds.  Meanwhile, the second process is started, and
given the name &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">my-process&lt;1&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo; for the sake of uniqueness.  It
inserts the directory listing at the end of the buffer &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;,
before the first process finishes.  Then it finishes, and a message to
that effect is inserted in the buffer.  Much later, the first process
finishes, and another message is inserted in the buffer for it.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (start-process "my-process" "foo" "sleep" "100")
               &rArr; #&lt;process my-process&gt;
          
          (start-process "my-process" "foo" "ls" "-l" "/user/lewis/bin")
               &rArr; #&lt;process my-process&lt;1&gt;&gt;
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>start-file-process</b><var> name buffer-or-name program &amp;rest args<a name="index-start_002dfile_002dprocess-3202"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Like <code>start-process</code>, this function starts a new asynchronous
subprocess running <var>program</var> in it, and returns its process
object&mdash;when <code>default-directory</code> is not a magic file name.

        <p>If <code>default-directory</code> is magic, the function invokes its file
handler instead.  This handler ought to run <var>program</var>, perhaps on
the local host, perhaps on a remote host that corresponds to
<code>default-directory</code>.  In the latter case, the local part of
<code>default-directory</code> becomes the working directory of the process.

        <p>This function does not try to invoke file name handlers for
<var>program</var> or for the <var>program-args</var>.

        <p>Depending on the implementation of the file handler, it might not be
possible to apply <code>process-filter</code> or <code>process-sentinel</code> to
the resulting process object (see <a href="Filter-Functions.html#Filter-Functions">Filter Functions</a>, see <a href="Sentinels.html#Sentinels">Sentinels</a>).

        <p>Some file handlers may not support <code>start-file-process</code> (for
example <code>ange-ftp-hook-function</code>).  In such cases, the function
does nothing and returns <code>nil</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>start-process-shell-command</b><var> name buffer-or-name command<a name="index-start_002dprocess_002dshell_002dcommand-3203"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is like <code>start-process</code> except that it uses a shell
to execute the specified command.  The argument <var>command</var> is a shell
command name.  The variable <code>shell-file-name</code> specifies which shell to
use.

        <p>The point of running a program through the shell, rather than directly
with <code>start-process</code>, is so that you can employ shell features such
as wildcards in the arguments.  It follows that if you include an
arbitrary user-specified arguments in the command, you should quote it
with <code>shell-quote-argument</code> first, so that any special shell
characters do <em>not</em> have their special shell meanings.  See <a href="Shell-Arguments.html#Shell-Arguments">Shell Arguments</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>start-file-process-shell-command</b><var> name buffer-or-name command<a name="index-start_002dfile_002dprocess_002dshell_002dcommand-3204"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is like <code>start-process-shell-command</code>, but uses
<code>start-file-process</code> internally.  By this, <var>command</var> can be
executed also on remote hosts, depending on <code>default-directory</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>process-connection-type</b><var><a name="index-process_002dconnection_002dtype-3205"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-pipes-3206"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040acronym_007bPTY_007ds-3207"></a>This variable controls the type of device used to communicate with
asynchronous subprocesses.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, then <acronym>PTY</acronym>s are
used, when available.  Otherwise, pipes are used.

        <p><acronym>PTY</acronym>s are usually preferable for processes visible to the user, as
in Shell mode, because they allow job control (<kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-z</kbd>,
etc.) to work between the process and its children, whereas pipes do
not.  For subprocesses used for internal purposes by programs, it is
often better to use a pipe, because they are more efficient.  In
addition, the total number of <acronym>PTY</acronym>s is limited on many systems and
it is good not to waste them.

        <p>The value of <code>process-connection-type</code> takes effect when
<code>start-process</code> is called.  So you can specify how to communicate
with one subprocess by binding the variable around the call to
<code>start-process</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (let ((process-connection-type nil))  ; <span class="roman">Use a pipe.</span>
            (start-process ...))
</pre>
        <p>To determine whether a given subprocess actually got a pipe or a
<acronym>PTY</acronym>, use the function <code>process-tty-name</code> (see <a href="Process-Information.html#Process-Information">Process Information</a>).
