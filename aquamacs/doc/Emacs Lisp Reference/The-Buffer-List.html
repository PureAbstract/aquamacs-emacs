<h3 class="section">27.8 The Buffer List</h3>

<p><a name="index-buffer-list-1943"></a>
  The <dfn>buffer list</dfn> is a list of all live buffers.  The order of
the buffers in the list is based primarily on how recently each buffer
has been displayed in a window.  Several functions, notably
<code>other-buffer</code>, use this ordering.  A buffer list displayed for
the user also follows this order.

   <p>Creating a buffer adds it to the end of the buffer list, and killing
a buffer removes it.  Buffers move to the front of the list when they
are selected for display in a window (see <a href="Displaying-Buffers.html#Displaying-Buffers">Displaying Buffers</a>), and
to the end when they are buried (see <code>bury-buffer</code>, below). 
There are no functions available to the Lisp programmer which directly
manipulate the buffer list.

   <p>In addition to the fundamental Emacs buffer list, each frame has its
own version of the buffer list, in which the buffers that have been
selected in that frame come first, starting with the buffers most
recently selected <em>in that frame</em>.  (This order is recorded in
<var>frame</var>'s <code>buffer-list</code> frame parameter; see <a href="Buffer-Parameters.html#Buffer-Parameters">Buffer Parameters</a>.)  The buffers that were never selected in <var>frame</var> come
afterward, ordered according to the fundamental Emacs buffer list.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>buffer-list</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-buffer_002dlist-1944"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the buffer list, including all buffers, even those
whose names begin with a space.  The elements are actual buffers, not
their names.

        <p>If <var>frame</var> is a frame, this returns <var>frame</var>'s buffer list.  If
<var>frame</var> is <code>nil</code>, the fundamental Emacs buffer list is used:
all the buffers appear in order of most recent selection, regardless of
which frames they were selected in.

     <pre class="example">          (buffer-list)
               =&gt; (#&lt;buffer buffers.texi&gt;
                   #&lt;buffer  *Minibuf-1*&gt; #&lt;buffer buffer.c&gt;
                   #&lt;buffer *Help*&gt; #&lt;buffer TAGS&gt;)
          
          ;; <span class="roman">Note that the name of the minibuffer</span>
          ;;   <span class="roman">begins with a space!</span>
          (mapcar (function buffer-name) (buffer-list))
              =&gt; ("buffers.texi" " *Minibuf-1*"
                  "buffer.c" "*Help*" "TAGS")
     </pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>The list that <code>buffer-list</code> returns is constructed specifically
by <code>buffer-list</code>; it is not an internal Emacs data structure, and
modifying it has no effect on the order of buffers.  If you want to
change the order of buffers in the frame-independent buffer list, here
is an easy way:

<pre class="example">     (defun reorder-buffer-list (new-list)
       (while new-list
         (bury-buffer (car new-list))
         (setq new-list (cdr new-list))))
</pre>
   <p>With this method, you can specify any order for the list, but there is
no danger of losing a buffer or adding something that is not a valid
live buffer.

   <p>To change the order or value of a frame's buffer list, set the frame's
<code>buffer-list</code> frame parameter with <code>modify-frame-parameters</code>
(see <a href="Parameter-Access.html#Parameter-Access">Parameter Access</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>other-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional buffer visible-ok frame<a name="index-other_002dbuffer-1945"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the first buffer in the buffer list other than
<var>buffer</var>.  Usually this is the buffer selected most recently (in
frame <var>frame</var> or else the currently selected frame, see <a href="Input-Focus.html#Input-Focus">Input Focus</a>), aside from <var>buffer</var>.  Buffers whose names start with a
space are not considered at all.

        <p>If <var>buffer</var> is not supplied (or if it is not a buffer), then
<code>other-buffer</code> returns the first buffer in the selected frame's
buffer list that is not now visible in any window in a visible frame.

        <p>If <var>frame</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>buffer-predicate</code> parameter,
then <code>other-buffer</code> uses that predicate to decide which buffers to
consider.  It calls the predicate once for each buffer, and if the value
is <code>nil</code>, that buffer is ignored.  See <a href="Buffer-Parameters.html#Buffer-Parameters">Buffer Parameters</a>.

     <!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
<p>If <var>visible-ok</var> is <code>nil</code>, <code>other-buffer</code> avoids returning
a buffer visible in any window on any visible frame, except as a last
resort.   If <var>visible-ok</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then it does not matter
whether a buffer is displayed somewhere or not.

        <p>If no suitable buffer exists, the buffer `<samp><span class="samp">*scratch*</span></samp>' is returned
(and created, if necessary). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>bury-buffer</b><var> &amp;optional buffer-or-name<a name="index-bury_002dbuffer-1946"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function puts <var>buffer-or-name</var> at the end of the buffer list,
without changing the order of any of the other buffers on the list. 
This buffer therefore becomes the least desirable candidate for
<code>other-buffer</code> to return.  The argument can be either a buffer
itself or the name of one.

        <p><code>bury-buffer</code> operates on each frame's <code>buffer-list</code> parameter
as well as the frame-independent Emacs buffer list; therefore, the
buffer that you bury will come last in the value of <code>(buffer-list
</code><var>frame</var><code>)</code> and in the value of <code>(buffer-list nil)</code>.

        <p>If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is <code>nil</code> or omitted, this means to bury the
current buffer.  In addition, if the buffer is displayed in the selected
window, this switches to some other buffer (obtained using
<code>other-buffer</code>) in the selected window.  But if the buffer is
displayed in some other window, it remains displayed there.

        <p>To replace a buffer in all the windows that display it, use
<code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>.  See <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html#Buffers-and-Windows">Buffers and Windows</a>.
