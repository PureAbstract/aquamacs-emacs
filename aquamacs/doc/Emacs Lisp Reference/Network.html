<h3 class="section">37.13 Network Connections</h3>

<p><a name="index-network-connection-3087"></a><a name="index-TCP-3088"></a><a name="index-UDP-3089"></a>
  Emacs Lisp programs can open stream (TCP) and datagram (UDP) network
connections to other processes on the same machine or other machines. 
A network connection is handled by Lisp much like a subprocess, and is
represented by a process object.  However, the process you are
communicating with is not a child of the Emacs process, so it has no
process <acronym>ID</acronym>, and you can't kill it or send it signals.  All you
can do is send and receive data.  <code>delete-process</code> closes the
connection, but does not kill the program at the other end; that
program must decide what to do about closure of the connection.

   <p>Lisp programs can listen for connections by creating network
servers.  A network server is also represented by a kind of process
object, but unlike a network connection, the network server never
transfers data itself.  When it receives a connection request, it
creates a new network connection to represent the connection just
made.  (The network connection inherits certain information, including
the process plist, from the server.)  The network server then goes
back to listening for more connection requests.

   <p>Network connections and servers are created by calling
<code>make-network-process</code> with an argument list consisting of
keyword/argument pairs, for example <code>:server t</code> to create a
server process, or <code>:type 'datagram</code> to create a datagram
connection.  See <a href="Low_002dLevel-Network.html#Low_002dLevel-Network">Low-Level Network</a>, for details.  You can also use
the <code>open-network-stream</code> function described below.

   <p>You can distinguish process objects representing network connections
and servers from those representing subprocesses with the
<code>process-status</code> function.  The possible status values for
network connections are <code>open</code>, <code>closed</code>, <code>connect</code>,
and <code>failed</code>.  For a network server, the status is always
<code>listen</code>.  None of those values is possible for a real
subprocess.  See <a href="Process-Information.html#Process-Information">Process Information</a>.

   <p>You can stop and resume operation of a network process by calling
<code>stop-process</code> and <code>continue-process</code>.  For a server
process, being stopped means not accepting new connections.  (Up to 5
connection requests will be queued for when you resume the server; you
can increase this limit, unless it is imposed by the operating
system.)  For a network stream connection, being stopped means not
processing input (any arriving input waits until you resume the
connection).  For a datagram connection, some number of packets may be
queued but input may be lost.  You can use the function
<code>process-command</code> to determine whether a network connection or
server is stopped; a non-<code>nil</code> value means yes.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>open-network-stream</b><var> name buffer-or-name host service<a name="index-open_002dnetwork_002dstream-3090"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function opens a TCP connection, and returns a process object
that represents the connection.

        <p>The <var>name</var> argument specifies the name for the process object.  It
is modified as necessary to make it unique.

        <p>The <var>buffer-or-name</var> argument is the buffer to associate with the
connection.  Output from the connection is inserted in the buffer,
unless you specify a filter function to handle the output.  If
<var>buffer-or-name</var> is <code>nil</code>, it means that the connection is not
associated with any buffer.

        <p>The arguments <var>host</var> and <var>service</var> specify where to connect to;
<var>host</var> is the host name (a string), and <var>service</var> is the name of
a defined network service (a string) or a port number (an integer). 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>process-contact</b><var> process &amp;optional key<a name="index-process_002dcontact-3091"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns information about how a network process was set
up.  For a connection, when <var>key</var> is <code>nil</code>, it returns
<code>(</code><var>hostname</var> <var>service</var><code>)</code> which specifies what you
connected to.

        <p>If <var>key</var> is <code>t</code>, the value is the complete status information
for the connection or server; that is, the list of keywords and values
specified in <code>make-network-process</code>, except that some of the
values represent the current status instead of what you specified:

          <dl>
<dt><code>:buffer</code><dd>The associated value is the process buffer. 
<br><dt><code>:filter</code><dd>The associated value is the process filter function. 
<br><dt><code>:sentinel</code><dd>The associated value is the process sentinel function. 
<br><dt><code>:remote</code><dd>In a connection, the address in internal format of the remote peer. 
<br><dt><code>:local</code><dd>The local address, in internal format. 
<br><dt><code>:service</code><dd>In a server, if you specified <code>t</code> for <var>service</var>,
this value is the actual port number. 
</dl>

        <p><code>:local</code> and <code>:remote</code> are included even if they were not
specified explicitly in <code>make-network-process</code>.

        <p>If <var>key</var> is a keyword, the function returns the value corresponding
to that keyword.

        <p>For an ordinary child process, this function always returns <code>t</code>.
