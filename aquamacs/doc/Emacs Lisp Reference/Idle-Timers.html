<h3 class="section">39.11 Idle Timers</h3>

<p>Here is how to set up a timer that runs when Emacs is idle for a
certain length of time.  Aside from how to set them up, idle timers
work just like ordinary timers.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>run-with-idle-timer</b><var> secs repeat function &amp;rest args<a name="index-run_002dwith_002didle_002dtimer-3788"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Set up a timer which runs when Emacs has been idle for <var>secs</var>
seconds.  The value of <var>secs</var> may be an integer or a floating point
number; a value of the type returned by <code>current-idle-time</code>
is also allowed.

        <p>If <var>repeat</var> is <code>nil</code>, the timer runs just once, the first time
Emacs remains idle for a long enough time.  More often <var>repeat</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, which means to run the timer <em>each time</em> Emacs
remains idle for <var>secs</var> seconds.

        <p>The function <code>run-with-idle-timer</code> returns a timer value which you
can use in calling <code>cancel-timer</code> (see <a href="Timers.html#Timers">Timers</a>). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-idleness-3789"></a>  Emacs becomes &ldquo;idle&rdquo; when it starts waiting for user input, and it
remains idle until the user provides some input.  If a timer is set for
five seconds of idleness, it runs approximately five seconds after Emacs
first becomes idle.  Even if <var>repeat</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this timer
will not run again as long as Emacs remains idle, because the duration
of idleness will continue to increase and will not go down to five
seconds again.

   <p>Emacs can do various things while idle: garbage collect, autosave or
handle data from a subprocess.  But these interludes during idleness do
not interfere with idle timers, because they do not reset the clock of
idleness to zero.  An idle timer set for 600 seconds will run when ten
minutes have elapsed since the last user command was finished, even if
subprocess output has been accepted thousands of times within those ten
minutes, and even if there have been garbage collections and autosaves.

   <p>When the user supplies input, Emacs becomes non-idle while executing the
input.  Then it becomes idle again, and all the idle timers that are
set up to repeat will subsequently run another time, one by one.

<!-- Emacs 19 feature -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-idle-time</b><var><a name="index-current_002didle_002dtime-3790"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If Emacs is idle, this function returns the length of time Emacs has
been idle, as a list of three integers: <code>(</code><var>high</var> <var>low</var>
<var>microsec</var><code>)</code>.  The integers <var>high</var> and <var>low</var> combine to
give the number of seconds of idleness, which is
<var>high</var> * 2**16 + <var>low</var>.

        <p>The third element, <var>microsec</var>, gives the microseconds since the
start of the current second (or 0 for systems that return time with
the resolution of only one second).

        <p>When Emacs is not idle, <code>current-idle-time</code> returns <code>nil</code>. 
This is a convenient way to test whether Emacs is idle.

        <p>The main use of this function is when an idle timer function wants to
&ldquo;take a break&rdquo; for a while.  It can set up another idle timer to
call the same function again, after a few seconds more idleness. 
Here's an example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (defvar resume-timer nil
            "Timer that `timer-function' used to reschedule itself, or nil.")
          
          (defun timer-function ()
            ;; <span class="roman">If the user types a command while </span><code>resume-timer</code>
            ;; <span class="roman">is active, the next time this function is called from</span>
            ;; <span class="roman">its main idle timer, deactivate </span><code>resume-timer</code><span class="roman">.</span>
            (when resume-timer
              (cancel-timer resume-timer))
            ...<var>do the work for a while</var>...
            (when <var>taking-a-break</var>
              (setq resume-timer
                    (run-with-idle-timer
                      ;; Compute an idle time <var>break-length</var>
                      ;; more than the current value.
                      (time-add (current-idle-time)
                                (seconds-to-time <var>break-length</var>))
                      nil
                      'timer-function))))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

   <p>Some idle timer functions in user Lisp packages have a loop that
does a certain amount of processing each time around, and exits when
<code>(input-pending-p)</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  That approach seems very
natural but has two problems:

     <ul>
<li>It blocks out all process output (since Emacs accepts process output
only while waiting).

     <li>It blocks out any idle timers that ought to run during that time. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">To avoid these problems, don't use that technique.  Instead, write
such idle timers to reschedule themselves after a brief pause, using
the method in the <code>timer-function</code> example above.
