<h3 class="section">28.8 Choosing a Window for Display</h3>

<p>This section describes the basic facility that chooses a window to
display a buffer in&mdash;<code>display-buffer</code>.  Higher-level functions and
commands, like <code>switch-to-buffer</code> and <code>pop-to-buffer</code>, use this
subroutine.  Here we describe how to use <code>display-buffer</code> and how
to customize it.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>display-buffer</b><var> buffer-or-name &amp;optional not-this-window frame<a name="index-display_002dbuffer-2091"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command makes <var>buffer-or-name</var> appear in some window, but it
does not select that window and does not make the buffer specified by
<var>buffer-or-name</var> current.  The identity of the selected window is
unaltered by this function.  The argument <var>buffer-or-name</var> must be a
buffer or the name of an existing buffer.

        <p><var>not-this-window</var> non-<code>nil</code> means to display the specified
buffer in a window other than the selected one, even if it is already
displayed in the selected window.  This can cause the buffer to appear
in two windows at once.  Otherwise, if <var>buffer-or-name</var> is already
being displayed in any window, that is good enough, so this function
does nothing.

        <p><code>display-buffer</code> returns the window chosen to display
<var>buffer-or-name</var>.

        <p>If the optional argument <var>frame</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it specifies
which frames to check when deciding whether the buffer is already
displayed.  If the buffer is already displayed in some window on one of
these frames, <code>display-buffer</code> simply returns that window.  Here
are the possible values of <var>frame</var>:

          <ul>
<li><code>nil</code> means consider windows on the selected frame. 
(Actually, the last non-minibuffer frame.) 
<li><code>t</code> means consider windows on all frames. 
<li><code>visible</code> means consider windows on all visible frames. 
<li>0 means consider windows on all visible or iconified frames. 
<li>A frame means consider windows on that frame only. 
</ul>

        <p>Precisely how <code>display-buffer</code> finds or creates a window depends on
the variables described below. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>display-buffer-reuse-frames</b><var><a name="index-display_002dbuffer_002dreuse_002dframes-2092"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>display-buffer</code> searches
visible and iconified frames for a window displaying
<var>buffer-or-name</var>.  If there is such a window, <code>display-buffer</code>
makes that window's frame visible and raises it if necessary, and
returns the window.  If there is no such window or
<code>display-buffer-reuse-frames</code> is <code>nil</code>, the behavior of
<code>display-buffer</code> is determined by the variables described next. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>pop-up-windows</b><var><a name="index-pop_002dup_002dwindows-2093"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies whether <code>display-buffer</code> is allowed to
split (see <a href="Splitting-Windows.html#Splitting-Windows">Splitting Windows</a>) an existing window.  If this variable
is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>display-buffer</code> tries to split the largest or
least recently used window on the selected frame.  (If the selected
frame is a minibuffer-only frame, <code>display-buffer</code> tries to split a
window on another frame instead.)  If this variable is <code>nil</code> or the
variable <code>pop-up-frames</code> (see below) is non-<code>nil</code>,
<code>display-buffer</code> does not split any window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>split-window-preferred-function</b><var><a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dpreferred_002dfunction-2094"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable must specify a function with one argument, which is a
window.  The <code>display-buffer</code> routines will call this function with
one or more candidate windows when they look for a window to split.  The
function is expected to split that window and return the new window.  If
the function returns <code>nil</code>, this means that the argument window
cannot (or shall not) be split.

        <p>The default value of <code>split-window-preferred-function</code> is the
function <code>split-window-sensibly</code> described below.  If you
customize this option, bear in mind that the <code>display-buffer</code>
routines may call your function up to two times when trying to split a
window.  The argument of the first call is the largest window on the
chosen frame (as returned by <code>get-largest-window</code>).  If that call
fails to return a live window, your function is called a second time
with the least recently used window on that frame (as returned by
<code>get-lru-window</code>).

        <p>The function specified by this option may try to split any other window
instead of the argument window.  Note that the window selected at the
time <code>display-buffer</code> was invoked is still selected when your
function is called.  Hence, you can split the selected window (instead
of the largest or least recently used one) by simply ignoring the window
argument in the body of your function.  You can even choose to not split
any window as long as the return value of your function specifies a live
window or <code>nil</code>, but you are not encouraged to do so
unconditionally.  If you want <code>display-buffer</code> to never split any
windows, set <code>pop-up-windows</code> to <code>nil</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>split-window-sensibly</b><var> window<a name="index-split_002dwindow_002dsensibly-2095"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function takes a window as argument and tries to split that window
in a suitable way.  The two variables described next are useful for
tuning the behavior of this function. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>split-height-threshold</b><var><a name="index-split_002dheight_002dthreshold-2096"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies whether <code>split-window-sensibly</code> may split
windows vertically.  If it is an integer, <code>split-window-sensibly</code>
tries to vertically split a window only if it has at least this many
lines.  If the window has less lines, splitting fails, or the value of
this variable is <code>nil</code>, <code>split-window-sensibly</code> will try to
split the window horizontally, subject to restrictions of
<code>split-width-threshold</code> (see below).  If splitting horizontally
fails too and the window is the only window on its frame,
<code>split-window-sensibly</code> will try to split the window vertically
disregarding the value of <code>split-height-threshold</code>.  If this fails
as well, <code>split-window-sensibly</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

        <p><code>split-window-sensibly</code> does not split vertically a window whose
height is fixed (see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>).  Also, it vertically splits
a window only if the space taken up by that window can accommodate two
windows one above the other that are both at least
<code>window-min-height</code> lines tall.  Moreover, if the window that shall
be split has a mode line, <code>split-window-sensibly</code> does not split
the window unless the new window can accomodate a mode line too. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>This variable specifies whether <code>split-window-sensibly</code> may split

tries to horizontally split a window only if it has at least this many
columns.  If it is <code>nil</code>, <code>split-window-sensibly</code> will not
split the window horizontally.  (It still might split the window
vertically, though, see above.)

        <p><code>split-window-sensibly</code> does not split horizontally a window if
that window's width is fixed (see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>).  Also, it
horizontally splits a window only if the space that window takes up can
accommodate two windows side by side that are both at least
<code>window-min-width</code> columns wide.

&mdash; User Option: <b>even-window-heights</b><var><a name="index-even_002dwindow_002dheights-2098"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable specifies whether <code>display-buffer</code> should even out
window heights if the buffer gets displayed in an existing window, above
or beneath another window.  If <code>even-window-heights</code> is
non-<code>nil</code>, the default, window heights will be evened out.  If
either of the involved window has fixed height (see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>) or <code>even-window-heights</code> is <code>nil</code>, the original
window heights will be left alone.

<blockquote><p>This variable specifies whether <code>display-buffer</code> should make new
frames.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>display-buffer</code> looks for a
window already displaying <var>buffer-or-name</var> on any visible or
iconified frame.  If it finds such a window, it makes that window's
frame visible and raises it if necessary, and returns the window. 
Otherwise it makes a new frame, unless the variable's value is
<code>graphic-only</code> and the selected frame is not on a graphic display. 
See <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>, for more information.

        <p>Note that the value of <code>pop-up-windows</code> does not matter if
<code>pop-up-frames</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.  If <code>pop-up-frames</code> is
<code>nil</code>, then <code>display-buffer</code> either splits a window or reuses
one.

<blockquote><p>A list of buffer names identifying buffers that should be displayed
specially.  If the name of <var>buffer-or-name</var> is in this list,
<code>display-buffer</code> handles the buffer specially.  By default, special
display means to give the buffer a dedicated frame.

        <p>If an element is a list, instead of a string, then the <span class="sc">car</span> of that
list is the buffer name, and the rest of that list says how to create
the frame.  There are two possibilities for the rest of that list (its
<span class="sc">cdr</span>): It can be an alist, specifying frame parameters, or it can
contain a function and arguments to give to it.  (The function's first
argument is always the buffer to be displayed; the arguments from the
list come after that.)

        <p>For example:

     <pre class="example">          (("myfile" (minibuffer) (menu-bar-lines . 0)))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">specifies to display a buffer named &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfile</span></samp>&rsquo; in a dedicated frame
with specified <code>minibuffer</code> and <code>menu-bar-lines</code> parameters.

        <p>The list of frame parameters can also use the phony frame parameters
<code>same-frame</code> and <code>same-window</code>.  If the specified frame
parameters include <code>(same-window . </code><var>value</var><code>)</code> and <var>value</var>
is non-<code>nil</code>, that means to display the buffer in the current
selected window.  Otherwise, if they include <code>(same-frame .

the buffer in a new window in the currently selected frame.
