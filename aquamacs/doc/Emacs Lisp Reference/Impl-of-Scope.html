<h4 class="subsection">11.9.3 Implementation of Dynamic Scoping</h4>

<p><a name="index-deep-binding-609"></a>
  A simple sample implementation (which is not how Emacs Lisp actually
works) may help you understand dynamic binding.  This technique is
called <dfn>deep binding</dfn> and was used in early Lisp systems.

   <p>Suppose there is a stack of bindings, which are variable-value pairs. 
At entry to a function or to a <code>let</code> form, we can push bindings
onto the stack for the arguments or local variables created there.  We
can pop those bindings from the stack at exit from the binding
construct.

   <p>We can find the value of a variable by searching the stack from top to
bottom for a binding for that variable; the value from that binding is
the value of the variable.  To set the variable, we search for the
current binding, then store the new value into that binding.

   <p>As you can see, a function's bindings remain in effect as long as it
continues execution, even during its calls to other functions.  That is
why we say the extent of the binding is dynamic.  And any other function
can refer to the bindings, if it uses the same variables while the
bindings are in effect.  That is why we say the scope is indefinite.

   <p><a name="index-shallow-binding-610"></a>  The actual implementation of variable scoping in GNU Emacs Lisp uses a
technique called <dfn>shallow binding</dfn>.  Each variable has a standard
place in which its current value is always found&mdash;the value cell of the
symbol.

   <p>In shallow binding, setting the variable works by storing a value in
the value cell.  Creating a new binding works by pushing the old value
(belonging to a previous binding) onto a stack, and storing the new
local value in the value cell.  Eliminating a binding works by popping
the old value off the stack, into the value cell.

   <p>We use shallow binding because it has the same results as deep
binding, but runs faster, since there is never a need to search for a
binding.
