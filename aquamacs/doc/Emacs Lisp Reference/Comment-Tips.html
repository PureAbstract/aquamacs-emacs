<h3 class="section">D.7 Tips on Writing Comments</h3>

<p><a name="index-comments_002c-Lisp-convention-for-3842"></a>
  We recommend these conventions for where to put comments and how to
indent them:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Comments that start with a single semicolon, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo;, should all be
aligned to the same column on the right of the source code.  Such
comments usually explain how the code on the same line does its job.  In
Lisp mode and related modes, the <kbd>M-;</kbd> (<code>indent-for-comment</code>)
command automatically inserts such a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>&rsquo; in the right place, or
aligns such a comment if it is already present.

     <p>This and following examples are taken from the Emacs sources.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (setq base-version-list                 ; there was a base
                (assoc (substring fn 0 start-vn)  ; version to which
                       file-version-assoc-list))  ; this looks like
                                                  ; a subversion
</pre>
     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Comments that start with two semicolons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;</span></samp>&rsquo;, should be aligned to
the same level of indentation as the code.  Such comments usually
describe the purpose of the following lines or the state of the program
at that point.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (prog1 (setq auto-fill-function
                       ...
                       ...
            ;; update mode line
            (force-mode-line-update)))
</pre>
     <p>We also normally use two semicolons for comments outside functions.

     <pre class="smallexample">          ;; This Lisp code is run in Emacs
          ;; when it is to operate as a server
          ;; for other processes.
</pre>
     <p>Every function that has no documentation string (presumably one that is
used only internally within the package it belongs to), should instead
have a two-semicolon comment right before the function, explaining what
the function does and how to call it properly.  Explain precisely what
each argument means and how the function interprets its possible values.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Comments that start with three semicolons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;</span></samp>&rsquo;, should start at
the left margin.  These are used, occasionally, for comments within
functions that should start at the margin.  We also use them sometimes
for comments that are between functions&mdash;whether to use two or three
semicolons depends on whether the comment should be considered a
&ldquo;heading&rdquo; by Outline minor mode.  By default, comments starting with
at least three semicolons (followed by a single space and a
non-whitespace character) are considered headings, comments starting
with two or less are not.

     <p>Another use for triple-semicolon comments is for commenting out lines
within a function.  We use three semicolons for this precisely so that
they remain at the left margin.  By default, Outline minor mode does
not consider a comment to be a heading (even if it starts with at
least three semicolons) if the semicolons are followed by at least two
spaces.  Thus, if you add an introductory comment to the commented out
code, make sure to indent it by at least two spaces after the three
semicolons.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (defun foo (a)
          ;;;  This is no longer necessary.
          ;;;  (force-mode-line-update)
            (message "Finished with %s" a))
</pre>
     <p>When commenting out entire functions, use two semicolons.

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;;</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Comments that start with four semicolons, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">;;;;</span></samp>&rsquo;, should be aligned
to the left margin and are used for headings of major sections of a
program.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          ;;;; The kill ring
</pre>
     </dl>

<p class="noindent">The indentation commands of the Lisp modes in Emacs, such as <kbd>M-;</kbd>
(<code>indent-for-comment</code>) and &lt;TAB&gt; (<code>lisp-indent-line</code>),
automatically indent comments according to these conventions,
depending on the number of semicolons.  See <a href="../emacs/Comments.html#Comments">Manipulating Comments</a>.
