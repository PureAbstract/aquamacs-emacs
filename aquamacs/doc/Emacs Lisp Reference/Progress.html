<h4 class="subsection">38.4.2 Reporting Operation Progress</h4>

<p><a name="index-progress-reporting-3341"></a>
  When an operation can take a while to finish, you should inform the
user about the progress it makes.  This way the user can estimate
remaining time and clearly see that Emacs is busy working, not hung.

   <p>Functions listed in this section provide simple and efficient way of
reporting operation progress.  Here is a working example that does
nothing useful:

<pre class="smallexample">     (let ((progress-reporter
            (make-progress-reporter "Collecting mana for Emacs..."
                                    0  500)))
       (dotimes (k 500)
         (sit-for 0.01)
         (progress-reporter-update progress-reporter k))
       (progress-reporter-done progress-reporter))
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-progress-reporter</b><var> message min-value max-value &amp;optional current-value min-change min-time<a name="index-make_002dprogress_002dreporter-3342"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function creates and returns a <dfn>progress reporter</dfn>&mdash;an
object you will use as an argument for all other functions listed
here.  The idea is to precompute as much data as possible to make
progress reporting very fast.

        <p>When this progress reporter is subsequently used, it will display
<var>message</var> in the echo area, followed by progress percentage. 
<var>message</var> is treated as a simple string.  If you need it to depend
on a filename, for instance, use <code>format</code> before calling this
function.

        <p><var>min-value</var> and <var>max-value</var> arguments stand for starting and
final states of your operation.  For instance, if you scan a buffer,
they should be the results of <code>point-min</code> and <code>point-max</code>
correspondingly.  It is required that <var>max-value</var> is greater than
<var>min-value</var>.  If you create progress reporter when some part of
the operation has already been completed, then specify
<var>current-value</var> argument.  But normally you should omit it or set
it to <code>nil</code>&mdash;it will default to <var>min-value</var> then.

        <p>Remaining arguments control the rate of echo area updates.  Progress
reporter will wait for at least <var>min-change</var> more percents of the
operation to be completed before printing next message. 
<var>min-time</var> specifies the minimum time in seconds to pass between
successive prints.  It can be fractional.  Depending on Emacs and
system capabilities, progress reporter may or may not respect this
last argument or do it with varying precision.  Default value for
<var>min-change</var> is 1 (one percent), for <var>min-time</var>&mdash;0.2
(seconds.)

        <p>This function calls <code>progress-reporter-update</code>, so the first
message is printed immediately. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>progress-reporter-update</b><var> reporter value<a name="index-progress_002dreporter_002dupdate-3343"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function does the main work of reporting progress of your
operation.  It displays the message of <var>reporter</var>, followed by
progress percentage determined by <var>value</var>.  If percentage is zero,
or close enough according to the <var>min-change</var> and <var>min-time</var>
arguments, then it is omitted from the output.

        <p><var>reporter</var> must be the result of a call to
<code>make-progress-reporter</code>.  <var>value</var> specifies the current
state of your operation and must be between <var>min-value</var> and
<var>max-value</var> (inclusive) as passed to
<code>make-progress-reporter</code>.  For instance, if you scan a buffer,
then <var>value</var> should be the result of a call to <code>point</code>.

        <p>This function respects <var>min-change</var> and <var>min-time</var> as passed
to <code>make-progress-reporter</code> and so does not output new messages
on every invocation.  It is thus very fast and normally you should not
try to reduce the number of calls to it: resulting overhead will most
likely negate your effort. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>progress-reporter-force-update</b><var> reporter value &amp;optional new-message<a name="index-progress_002dreporter_002dforce_002dupdate-3344"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function is similar to <code>progress-reporter-update</code> except
that it prints a message in the echo area unconditionally.

        <p>The first two arguments have the same meaning as for
<code>progress-reporter-update</code>.  Optional <var>new-message</var> allows
you to change the message of the <var>reporter</var>.  Since this functions
always updates the echo area, such a change will be immediately
presented to the user. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>progress-reporter-done</b><var> reporter<a name="index-progress_002dreporter_002ddone-3345"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function should be called when the operation is finished.  It
prints the message of <var>reporter</var> followed by word &ldquo;done&rdquo; in the
echo area.

        <p>You should always call this function and not hope for
<code>progress-reporter-update</code> to print &ldquo;100%.&rdquo;  Firstly, it may
never print it, there are many good reasons for this not to happen. 
Secondly, &ldquo;done&rdquo; is more explicit. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>dotimes-with-progress-reporter</b> (<var>var count </var>[<var>result</var>])<var> message body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-dotimes_002dwith_002dprogress_002dreporter-3346"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This is a convenience macro that works the same way as <code>dotimes</code>
does, but also reports loop progress using the functions described
above.  It allows you to save some typing.

        <p>You can rewrite the example in the beginning of this node using
this macro this way:

     <pre class="example">          (dotimes-with-progress-reporter
              (k 500)
              "Collecting some mana for Emacs..."
            (sit-for 0.01))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
