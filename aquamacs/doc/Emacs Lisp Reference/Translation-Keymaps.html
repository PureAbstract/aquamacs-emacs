<h3 class="section">22.14 Keymaps for Translating Sequences of Events</h3>

<p><a name="index-keymaps-for-translating-events-1479"></a>
  This section describes keymaps that are used during reading a key
sequence, to translate certain event sequences into others. 
<code>read-key-sequence</code> checks every subsequence of the key sequence
being read, as it is read, against <code>function-key-map</code> and then
against <code>key-translation-map</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>function-key-map</b><var><a name="index-function_002dkey_002dmap-1480"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a keymap that describes the character sequences sent
by function keys on an ordinary character terminal.  This keymap has the
same structure as other keymaps, but is used differently: it specifies
translations to make while reading key sequences, rather than bindings
for key sequences.

        <p>If <code>function-key-map</code> &ldquo;binds&rdquo; a key sequence <var>k</var> to a vector
<var>v</var>, then when <var>k</var> appears as a subsequence <em>anywhere</em> in a
key sequence, it is replaced with the events in <var>v</var>.

        <p>For example, VT100 terminals send <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; O P</kbd> when the
keypad &lt;PF1&gt; key is pressed.  Therefore, we want Emacs to translate
that sequence of events into the single event <code>pf1</code>.  We accomplish
this by &ldquo;binding&rdquo; <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; O P</kbd> to <code>[pf1]</code> in
<code>function-key-map</code>, when using a VT100.

        <p>Thus, typing <kbd>C-c &lt;PF1&gt;</kbd> sends the character sequence <kbd>C-c
&lt;ESC&gt; O P</kbd>; later the function <code>read-key-sequence</code> translates
this back into <kbd>C-c &lt;PF1&gt;</kbd>, which it returns as the vector
<code>[?\C-c pf1]</code>.

        <p>Entries in <code>function-key-map</code> are ignored if they conflict with
bindings made in the minor mode, local, or global keymaps.  The intent
is that the character sequences that function keys send should not have
command bindings in their own right&mdash;but if they do, the ordinary
bindings take priority.

        <p>The value of <code>function-key-map</code> is usually set up automatically
according to the terminal's Terminfo or Termcap entry, but sometimes
those need help from terminal-specific Lisp files.  Emacs comes with
terminal-specific files for many common terminals; their main purpose is
to make entries in <code>function-key-map</code> beyond those that can be
deduced from Termcap and Terminfo.  See <a href="Terminal_002dSpecific.html#Terminal_002dSpecific">Terminal-Specific</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>key-translation-map</b><var><a name="index-key_002dtranslation_002dmap-1481"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable is another keymap used just like <code>function-key-map</code>
to translate input events into other events.  It differs from
<code>function-key-map</code> in two ways:

          <ul>
<li><code>key-translation-map</code> goes to work after <code>function-key-map</code> is
finished; it receives the results of translation by
<code>function-key-map</code>.

          <li>Non-prefix bindings in <code>key-translation-map</code> override actual key
bindings.  For example, if <kbd>C-x f</kbd> has a non-prefix binding in
<code>key-translation-map</code>, that translation takes effect even though
<kbd>C-x f</kbd> also has a key binding in the global map. 
</ul>

        <p>Note however that actual key bindings can have an effect on
<code>key-translation-map</code>, even though they are overridden by it. 
Indeed, actual key bindings override <code>function-key-map</code> and thus
may alter the key sequence that <code>key-translation-map</code> receives. 
Clearly, it is better to avoid this type of situation.

        <p>The intent of <code>key-translation-map</code> is for users to map one
character set to another, including ordinary characters normally bound
to <code>self-insert-command</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-key-translation-function-1482"></a>You can use <code>function-key-map</code> or <code>key-translation-map</code> for
more than simple aliases, by using a function, instead of a key
sequence, as the &ldquo;translation&rdquo; of a key.  Then this function is called
to compute the translation of that key.

   <p>The key translation function receives one argument, which is the prompt
that was specified in <code>read-key-sequence</code>&mdash;or <code>nil</code> if the
key sequence is being read by the editor command loop.  In most cases
you can ignore the prompt value.

   <p>If the function reads input itself, it can have the effect of altering
the event that follows.  For example, here's how to define <kbd>C-c h</kbd>
to turn the character that follows into a Hyper character:

<pre class="example">     (defun hyperify (prompt)
       (let ((e (read-event)))
         (vector (if (numberp e)
                     (logior (lsh 1 24) e)
                   (if (memq 'hyper (event-modifiers e))
                       e
                     (add-event-modifier "H-" e))))))
     
     (defun add-event-modifier (string e)
       (let ((symbol (if (symbolp e) e (car e))))
         (setq symbol (intern (concat string
                                      (symbol-name symbol))))
         (if (symbolp e)
             symbol
           (cons symbol (cdr e)))))
     
     (define-key function-key-map "\C-ch" 'hyperify)
</pre>
   <p>If you have enabled keyboard character set decoding using
<code>set-keyboard-coding-system</code>, decoding is done after the
translations listed above.  See <a href="Terminal-I_002fO-Encoding.html#Terminal-I_002fO-Encoding">Terminal I/O Encoding</a>.  However, in
future Emacs versions, character set decoding may be done at an
earlier stage.
