<h4 class="subsection">38.15.1 Display Specs That Replace The Text</h4>

<p>Some kinds of <code>display</code> specifications specify something to
display instead of the text that has the property.  These are called
<dfn>replacing</dfn> display specifications.  Emacs does not allow the user
to interactively move point into the middle of buffer text that is
replaced in this way.

   <p>If a list of display specifications includes more than one replacing
display specification, the first overrides the rest.  Replacing
display specifications make most other display specifications
irrelevant, since those don't apply to the replacement.

   <p>For replacing display specifications, &ldquo;the text that has the
property&rdquo; means all the consecutive characters that have the same
Lisp object as their <code>display</code> property; these characters are
replaced as a single unit.  By contrast, characters that have similar
but distinct Lisp objects as their <code>display</code> properties are
handled separately.  Here's a function that illustrates this point:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun foo ()
       (goto-char (point-min))
       (dotimes (i 5)
         (let ((string (concat "A")))
           (put-text-property (point) (1+ (point)) 'display string)
           (forward-char 1)
           (put-text-property (point) (1+ (point)) 'display string)
           (forward-char 1))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">It gives each of the first ten characters in the buffer string
<code>"A"</code> as the <code>display</code> property, but they don't all get the
same string.  The first two characters get the same string, so they
together are replaced with one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The next two characters get
a second string, so they together are replaced with one &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Likewise for each following pair of characters.  Thus, the ten
characters appear as five A's.  This function would have the same
results:

<pre class="smallexample">     (defun foo ()
       (goto-char (point-min))
       (dotimes (i 5)
         (let ((string (concat "A")))
           (put-text-property (point) (+ 2 (point)) 'display string)
           (put-text-property (point) (1+ (point)) 'display string)
           (forward-char 2))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This illustrates that what matters is the property value for
each character.  If two consecutive characters have the same
object as the <code>display</code> property value, it's irrelevant
whether they got this property from a single call to
<code>put-text-property</code> or from two different calls.
