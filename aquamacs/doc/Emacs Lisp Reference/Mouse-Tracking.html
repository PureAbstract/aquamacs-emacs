<p><a name="index-mouse-tracking-2312"></a><!-- @cindex tracking the mouse   Duplicates track-mouse -->

   <p>Sometimes it is useful to <dfn>track</dfn> the mouse, which means to display
something to indicate where the mouse is and move the indicator as the
mouse moves.  For efficient mouse tracking, you need a way to wait until
the mouse actually moves.

   <p>The convenient way to track the mouse is to ask for events to represent
mouse motion.  Then you can wait for motion by waiting for an event.  In
addition, you can easily handle any other sorts of events that may
occur.  That is useful, because normally you don't want to track the
mouse forever&mdash;only until some other event, such as the release of a
button.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>track-mouse</b><var> body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-track_002dmouse-2313"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form executes <var>body</var>, with generation of mouse motion
events enabled.  Typically, <var>body</var> would use <code>read-event</code> to
read the motion events and modify the display accordingly.  See <a href="Motion-Events.html#Motion-Events">Motion Events</a>, for the format of mouse motion events.

        <p>The value of <code>track-mouse</code> is that of the last form in <var>body</var>. 
You should design <var>body</var> to return when it sees the up-event that
indicates the release of the button, or whatever kind of event means
it is time to stop tracking. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The usual purpose of tracking mouse motion is to indicate on the screen
the consequences of pushing or releasing a button at the current
position.

   <p>In many cases, you can avoid the need to track the mouse by using
the <code>mouse-face</code> text property (see <a href="Special-Properties.html#Special-Properties">Special Properties</a>). 
That works at a much lower level and runs more smoothly than
Lisp-level mouse tracking.
