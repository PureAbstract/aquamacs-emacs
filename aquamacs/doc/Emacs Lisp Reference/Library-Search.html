<h3 class="section">15.3 Library Search</h3>

<p><a name="index-library-search-774"></a><a name="index-find-library-775"></a>
  When Emacs loads a Lisp library, it searches for the library
in a list of directories specified by the variable <code>load-path</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>load-path</b><var><a name="index-load_002dpath-776"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bEMACSLOADPATH_007d-environment-variable-777"></a>The value of this variable is a list of directories to search when
loading files with <code>load</code>.  Each element is a string (which must be
a directory name) or <code>nil</code> (which stands for the current working
directory). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The value of <code>load-path</code> is initialized from the environment
variable <code>EMACSLOADPATH</code>, if that exists; otherwise its default
value is specified in <samp><span class="file">emacs/src/epaths.h</span></samp> when Emacs is built. 
Then the list is expanded by adding subdirectories of the directories
in the list.

   <p>The syntax of <code>EMACSLOADPATH</code> is the same as used for <code>PATH</code>;
`<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>' (or `<samp><span class="samp">;</span></samp>', according to the operating system) separates
directory names, and `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' is used for the current default directory. 
Here is an example of how to set your <code>EMACSLOADPATH</code> variable from
a <code>csh</code> <samp><span class="file">.login</span></samp> file:

<pre class="smallexample">     setenv EMACSLOADPATH .:/user/bil/emacs:/usr/local/share/emacs/20.3/lisp
</pre>
   <p>Here is how to set it using <code>sh</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     export EMACSLOADPATH
     EMACSLOADPATH=.:/user/bil/emacs:/usr/local/share/emacs/20.3/lisp
</pre>
   <p>Here is an example of code you can place in your init file (see <a href="Init-File.html#Init-File">Init File</a>) to add several directories to the front of your default
<code>load-path</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     (setq load-path
           (append (list nil "/user/bil/emacs"
                         "/usr/local/lisplib"
                         "~/emacs")
                   load-path))
</pre>
   <!-- Wordy to rid us of an overfull hbox.  -rjc 15mar92 -->
<p class="noindent">In this example, the path searches the current working directory first,
followed then by the <samp><span class="file">/user/bil/emacs</span></samp> directory, the
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lisplib</span></samp> directory, and the <samp><span class="file">~/emacs</span></samp> directory,
which are then followed by the standard directories for Lisp code.

   <p>Dumping Emacs uses a special value of <code>load-path</code>.  If the value of
<code>load-path</code> at the end of dumping is unchanged (that is, still the
same special value), the dumped Emacs switches to the ordinary
<code>load-path</code> value when it starts up, as described above.  But if
<code>load-path</code> has any other value at the end of dumping, that value
is used for execution of the dumped Emacs also.

   <p>Therefore, if you want to change <code>load-path</code> temporarily for
loading a few libraries in <samp><span class="file">site-init.el</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">site-load.el</span></samp>,
you should bind <code>load-path</code> locally with <code>let</code> around the
calls to <code>load</code>.

   <p>The default value of <code>load-path</code>, when running an Emacs which has
been installed on the system, includes two special directories (and
their subdirectories as well):

<pre class="smallexample">     "/usr/local/share/emacs/<var>version</var>/site-lisp"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and

<pre class="smallexample">     "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first one is for locally installed packages for a particular Emacs
version; the second is for locally installed packages meant for use with
all installed Emacs versions.

   <p>There are several reasons why a Lisp package that works well in one
Emacs version can cause trouble in another.  Sometimes packages need
updating for incompatible changes in Emacs; sometimes they depend on
undocumented internal Emacs data that can change without notice;
sometimes a newer Emacs version incorporates a version of the package,
and should be used only with that version.

   <p>Emacs finds these directories' subdirectories and adds them to
<code>load-path</code> when it starts up.  Both immediate subdirectories and
subdirectories multiple levels down are added to <code>load-path</code>.

   <p>Not all subdirectories are included, though.  Subdirectories whose
names do not start with a letter or digit are excluded.  Subdirectories
named <samp><span class="file">RCS</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">CVS</span></samp> are excluded.  Also, a subdirectory which
contains a file named <samp><span class="file">.nosearch</span></samp> is excluded.  You can use these
methods to prevent certain subdirectories of the <samp><span class="file">site-lisp</span></samp>
directories from being searched.

   <p>If you run Emacs from the directory where it was built&mdash;that is, an
executable that has not been formally installed&mdash;then <code>load-path</code>
normally contains two additional directories.  These are the <code>lisp</code>
and <code>site-lisp</code> subdirectories of the main build directory.  (Both
are represented as absolute file names.)

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Command: <b>locate-library</b><var> library &amp;optional nosuffix path interactive-call<a name="index-locate_002dlibrary-778"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command finds the precise file name for library <var>library</var>.  It
searches for the library in the same way <code>load</code> does, and the
argument <var>nosuffix</var> has the same meaning as in <code>load</code>: don't
add suffixes `<samp><span class="samp">.elc</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">.el</span></samp>' to the specified name
<var>library</var>.

        <p>If the <var>path</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that list of directories is used
instead of <code>load-path</code>.

        <p>When <code>locate-library</code> is called from a program, it returns the file
name as a string.  When the user runs <code>locate-library</code>
interactively, the argument <var>interactive-call</var> is <code>t</code>, and this
tells <code>locate-library</code> to display the file name in the echo area. 
</p></blockquote></div>
