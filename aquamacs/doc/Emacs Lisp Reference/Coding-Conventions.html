<h3 class="section">D.1 Emacs Lisp Coding Conventions</h3>

<p><a name="index-coding-conventions-in-Emacs-Lisp-3823"></a>  Here are conventions that you should follow when writing Emacs Lisp
code intended for widespread use:

     <ul>
<li>Simply loading a package should not change Emacs's editing behavior. 
Include a command or commands to enable and disable the feature,
or to invoke it.

     <p>This convention is mandatory for any file that includes custom
definitions.  If fixing such a file to follow this convention requires
an incompatible change, go ahead and make the incompatible change;
don't postpone it.

     <li>You should choose a short word to distinguish your program from other
Lisp programs.  The names of all global variables, constants, and
functions in your program should begin with that chosen prefix. 
Separate the prefix from the rest of the name with a hyphen, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
This practice helps avoid name conflicts, since all global variables
in Emacs Lisp share the same name space, and all functions share
another name space<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

     <p>Occasionally, for a command name intended for users to use, it is more
convenient if some words come before the package's name prefix.  And
constructs that define functions, variables, etc., work better if they
start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">defun</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">defvar</span></samp>&rsquo;, so put the name prefix later
on in the name.

     <p>This recommendation applies even to names for traditional Lisp
primitives that are not primitives in Emacs Lisp&mdash;such as
<code>copy-list</code>.  Believe it or not, there is more than one plausible
way to define <code>copy-list</code>.  Play it safe; append your name prefix
to produce a name like <code>foo-copy-list</code> or <code>mylib-copy-list</code>
instead.

     <p>If you write a function that you think ought to be added to Emacs under
a certain name, such as <code>twiddle-files</code>, don't call it by that name
in your program.  Call it <code>mylib-twiddle-files</code> in your program,
and send mail to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org</span></samp>&rsquo; suggesting we add
it to Emacs.  If and when we do, we can change the name easily enough.

     <p>If one prefix is insufficient, your package can use two or three
alternative common prefixes, so long as they make sense.

     <li>Put a call to <code>provide</code> at the end of each separate Lisp file. 
See <a href="Named-Features.html#Named-Features">Named Features</a>.

     <li>If a file requires certain other Lisp programs to be loaded
beforehand, then the comments at the beginning of the file should say
so.  Also, use <code>require</code> to make sure they are loaded. 
See <a href="Named-Features.html#Named-Features">Named Features</a>.

     <li>If a file <var>foo</var> uses a macro defined in another file <var>bar</var>,
but does not use any functions or variables defined in <var>bar</var>, then
<var>foo</var> should contain the following expression:

     <pre class="example">          (eval-when-compile (require '<var>bar</var>))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">This tells Emacs to load <var>bar</var> just before byte-compiling
<var>foo</var>, so that the macro definition is available during
compilation.  Using <code>eval-when-compile</code> avoids loading <var>bar</var>
when the compiled version of <var>foo</var> is <em>used</em>.  It should be
called before the first use of the macro in the file.  See <a href="Compiling-Macros.html#Compiling-Macros">Compiling Macros</a>.

     <li>Please don't require the <code>cl</code> package of Common Lisp extensions at
run time.  Use of this package is optional, and it is not part of the
standard Emacs namespace.  If your package loads <code>cl</code> at run time,
that could cause name clashes for users who don't use that package.

     <p>However, there is no problem with using the <code>cl</code> package at
compile time, with <code>(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))</code>.  That's
sufficient for using the macros in the <code>cl</code> package, because the
compiler expands them before generating the byte-code.

     <li>When defining a major mode, please follow the major mode
conventions.  See <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions">Major Mode Conventions</a>.

     <li>When defining a minor mode, please follow the minor mode
conventions.  See <a href="Minor-Mode-Conventions.html#Minor-Mode-Conventions">Minor Mode Conventions</a>.

     <li>If the purpose of a function is to tell you whether a certain
condition is true or false, give the function a name that ends in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo; (which stands for &ldquo;predicate&rdquo;).  If the name is one word,
add just &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>&rsquo;; if the name is multiple words, add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Examples are <code>framep</code> and <code>frame-live-p</code>.

     <li>If the purpose of a variable is to store a single function, give it a
name that ends in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-function</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If the purpose of a variable is
to store a list of functions (i.e., the variable is a hook), please
follow the naming conventions for hooks.  See <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.

     <li><a name="index-unloading-packages_002c-preparing-for-3824"></a>If loading the file adds functions to hooks, define a function
<var>feature</var><code>-unload-hook</code>, where <var>feature</var> is the name of
the feature the package provides, and make it undo any such changes. 
Using <code>unload-feature</code> to unload the file will run this function. 
See <a href="Unloading.html#Unloading">Unloading</a>.

     <li>It is a bad idea to define aliases for the Emacs primitives.  Normally
you should use the standard names instead.  The case where an alias
may be useful is where it facilitates backwards compatibility or
portability.

     <li>If a package needs to define an alias or a new function for
compatibility with some other version of Emacs, name it with the package
prefix, not with the raw name with which it occurs in the other version. 
Here is an example from Gnus, which provides many examples of such
compatibility issues.

     <pre class="example">          (defalias 'gnus-point-at-bol
            (if (fboundp 'point-at-bol)
                'point-at-bol
              'line-beginning-position))
</pre>
     <li>Redefining or advising an Emacs primitive is a bad idea.  It may do
the right thing for a particular program, but there is no telling what
other programs might break as a result.

     <li>It is likewise a bad idea for one Lisp package to advise a function in
another Lisp package (see <a href="Advising-Functions.html#Advising-Functions">Advising Functions</a>).

     <li>Avoid using <code>eval-after-load</code> in libraries and packages
(see <a href="Hooks-for-Loading.html#Hooks-for-Loading">Hooks for Loading</a>).  This feature is meant for personal
customizations; using it in a Lisp program is unclean, because it
modifies the behavior of another Lisp file in a way that's not visible
in that file.  This is an obstacle for debugging, much like advising a
function in the other package.

     <li>If a file does replace any of the standard functions or library
programs of Emacs, prominent comments at the beginning of the file
should say which functions are replaced, and how the behavior of the
replacements differs from that of the originals.

     <li>Constructs that define a function or variable should be macros,
not functions, and their names should start with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">def</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>A macro that defines a function or variable should have a name that
starts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">define-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The macro should receive the name to be
defined as the first argument.  That will help various tools find the
definition automatically.  Avoid constructing the names in the macro
itself, since that would confuse these tools.

     <li>Please keep the names of your Emacs Lisp source files to 13 characters
or less.  This way, if the files are compiled, the compiled files' names
will be 14 characters or less, which is short enough to fit on all kinds
of Unix systems.

     <li>In some other systems there is a convention of choosing variable names
that begin and end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;.  We don't use that convention in Emacs
Lisp, so please don't use it in your programs.  (Emacs uses such names
only for special-purpose buffers.)  The users will find Emacs more
coherent if all libraries use the same conventions.

     <li>If your program contains non-ASCII characters in string or character
constants, you should make sure Emacs always decodes these characters
the same way, regardless of the user's settings.  The easiest way to
do this is to use the coding system <code>utf-8-emacs</code> (see <a href="Coding-System-Basics.html#Coding-System-Basics">Coding System Basics</a>), and specify that coding in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-*-</span></samp>&rsquo; line or the
local variables list.  See <a href="../emacs/File-variables.html#File-variables">Local Variables in Files</a>.

     <pre class="example">          ;; XXX.el  -*- coding: utf-8-emacs; -*-
</pre>
     <li>Indent each function with <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> (<code>indent-sexp</code>) using the
default indentation parameters.

     <li>Don't make a habit of putting close-parentheses on lines by
themselves; Lisp programmers find this disconcerting.

     <li>Please put a copyright notice and copying permission notice on the
file if you distribute copies.  Use a notice like this one:

     <pre class="smallexample">          ;; Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name</var>
