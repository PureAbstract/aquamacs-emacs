<h3 class="section">28.18 Window Configurations</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-configurations-2109"></a><a name="index-saving-window-information-2110"></a>
  A <dfn>window configuration</dfn> records the entire layout of one
frame&mdash;all windows, their sizes, which buffers they contain, what
part of each buffer is displayed, and the values of point and the
mark; also their fringes, margins, and scroll bar settings.  It also
includes the values of <code>window-min-height</code>,
<code>window-min-width</code> and <code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code>.  An
exception is made for point in the selected window for the current
buffer; its value is not saved in the window configuration.

   <p>You can bring back an entire previous layout by restoring a window
configuration previously saved.  If you want to record all frames
instead of just one, use a frame configuration instead of a window
configuration.  See <a href="Frame-Configurations.html#Frame-Configurations">Frame Configurations</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-window-configuration</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-current_002dwindow_002dconfiguration-2111"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a new object representing <var>frame</var>'s current
window configuration.  If <var>frame</var> is omitted, the selected frame
is used. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>set-window-configuration</b><var> configuration<a name="index-set_002dwindow_002dconfiguration-2112"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function restores the configuration of windows and buffers as
specified by <var>configuration</var>, for the frame that <var>configuration</var>
was created for.

        <p>The argument <var>configuration</var> must be a value that was previously
returned by <code>current-window-configuration</code>.  This configuration is
restored in the frame from which <var>configuration</var> was made, whether
that frame is selected or not.  This always counts as a window size
change and triggers execution of the <code>window-size-change-functions</code>
(see <a href="Window-Hooks.html#Window-Hooks">Window Hooks</a>), because <code>set-window-configuration</code> doesn't
know how to tell whether the new configuration actually differs from the
old one.

        <p>If the frame which <var>configuration</var> was saved from is dead, all this
function does is restore the three variables <code>window-min-height</code>,
<code>window-min-width</code> and <code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code>. In this
case, the function returns <code>nil</code>.  Otherwise, it returns <code>t</code>.

        <p>Here is a way of using this function to get the same effect
as <code>save-window-excursion</code>:

     <pre class="example">          (let ((config (current-window-configuration)))
            (unwind-protect
                (progn (split-window-vertically nil)
                       ...)
              (set-window-configuration config)))
     </pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Special Form: <b>save-window-excursion</b><var> forms<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-save_002dwindow_002dexcursion-2113"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This special form records the window configuration, executes <var>forms</var>
in sequence, then restores the earlier window configuration.  The window
configuration includes, for each window, the value of point and the
portion of the buffer that is visible.  It also includes the choice of
selected window.  However, it does not include the value of point in
the current buffer; use <code>save-excursion</code> also, if you wish to
preserve that.

        <p>Don't use this construct when <code>save-selected-window</code> is sufficient.

        <p>Exit from <code>save-window-excursion</code> always triggers execution of the
<code>window-size-change-functions</code>.  (It doesn't know how to tell
whether the restored configuration actually differs from the one in
effect at the end of the <var>forms</var>.)

        <p>The return value is the value of the final form in <var>forms</var>. 
For example:

     <pre class="example">          (split-window)
               =&gt; #&lt;window 25 on control.texi&gt;
          (setq w (selected-window))
               =&gt; #&lt;window 19 on control.texi&gt;
          (save-window-excursion
            (delete-other-windows w)
            (switch-to-buffer "foo")
            'do-something)
               =&gt; do-something
               ;; <span class="roman">The screen is now split again.</span>
     </pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-configuration-p</b><var> object<a name="index-window_002dconfiguration_002dp-2114"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a window configuration. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>compare-window-configurations</b><var> config1 config2<a name="index-compare_002dwindow_002dconfigurations-2115"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function compares two window configurations as regards the
structure of windows, but ignores the values of point and mark and the
saved scrolling positions&mdash;it can return <code>t</code> even if those
aspects differ.

        <p>The function <code>equal</code> can also compare two window configurations; it
regards configurations as unequal if they differ in any respect, even a
saved point or mark. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>window-configuration-frame</b><var> config<a name="index-window_002dconfiguration_002dframe-2116"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the frame for which the window configuration
<var>config</var> was made. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Other primitives to look inside of window configurations would make
sense, but are not implemented because we did not need them.  See the
file <samp><span class="file">winner.el</span></samp> for some more operations on windows
configurations.
