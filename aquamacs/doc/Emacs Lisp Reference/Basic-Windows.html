<h3 class="section">28.1 Basic Concepts of Emacs Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-2037"></a><a name="index-selected-window-2038"></a>
  A <dfn>window</dfn> in Emacs is the physical area of the screen in which a
buffer is displayed.  The term is also used to refer to a Lisp object that
represents that screen area in Emacs Lisp.  It should be
clear from the context which is meant.

   <p>Emacs groups windows into frames; see <a href="Frames.html#Frames">Frames</a>.  A frame
represents an area of screen available for Emacs to use.  Each frame
always contains at least one window, but you can subdivide it
vertically or horizontally into multiple, nonoverlapping Emacs
windows.

   <p>In each frame, at any time, one and only one window is designated as
<dfn>selected within the frame</dfn>.  The frame's cursor appears in that
window, but the other windows have &ldquo;non-selected&rdquo; cursors, normally
less visible.  (See <a href="Cursor-Parameters.html#Cursor-Parameters">Cursor Parameters</a>, for customizing this.)  At
any time, one frame is the selected frame; and the window selected
within that frame is <dfn>the selected window</dfn>.  The selected window's
buffer is usually the current buffer (except when <code>set-buffer</code> has
been used); see <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>.

   <p>For practical purposes, a window exists only while it is displayed in
a frame.  Once removed from the frame, the window is effectively deleted
and should not be used, <em>even though there may still be references
to it</em> from other Lisp objects; see <a href="Deleting-Windows.html#Deleting-Windows">Deleting Windows</a>.  Restoring a
saved window configuration is the only way for a window no longer on the
screen to come back to life; see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>.

   <p><a name="index-multiple-windows-2039"></a>  Users create multiple windows so they can look at several buffers at
once.  Lisp libraries use multiple windows for a variety of reasons, but
most often to display related information.  In Rmail, for example, you
can move through a summary buffer in one window while the other window
shows messages one at a time as they are reached.

   <p>The meaning of &ldquo;window&rdquo; in Emacs is similar to what it means in the
context of general-purpose window systems such as X, but not identical. 
The X Window System places X windows on the screen; Emacs uses one or
more X windows as frames, and subdivides them into
Emacs windows.  When you use Emacs on a character-only terminal, Emacs
treats the whole terminal screen as one frame.

   <p><a name="index-terminal-screen-2040"></a><a name="index-screen-of-terminal-2041"></a><a name="index-tiled-windows-2042"></a>  Most window systems support arbitrarily located overlapping windows. 
In contrast, Emacs windows are <dfn>tiled</dfn>; they never overlap, and
together they fill the whole screen or frame.  Because of the way in
which Emacs creates new windows (see <a href="Splitting-Windows.html#Splitting-Windows">Splitting Windows</a>) and resizes
them (see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>), not all conceivable tilings of windows
on an Emacs frame are actually possible.
