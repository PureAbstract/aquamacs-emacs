<h3 class="section">28.1 Basic Concepts of Emacs Windows</h3>

<p><a name="index-window-1966"></a><a name="index-selected-window-1967"></a>
  A <dfn>window</dfn> in Emacs is the physical area of the screen in which a
buffer is displayed.  The term is also used to refer to a Lisp object that
represents that screen area in Emacs Lisp.  It should be
clear from the context which is meant.

   <p>Emacs groups windows into frames.  A frame represents an area of
screen available for Emacs to use.  Each frame always contains at least
one window, but you can subdivide it vertically or horizontally into
multiple nonoverlapping Emacs windows.

   <p>In each frame, at any time, one and only one window is designated as
<dfn>selected within the frame</dfn>.  The frame's cursor appears in that
window, but the other windows have &ldquo;non-selected&rdquo; cursors, normally
less visible.  At any time, one frame is the selected frame; and the
window selected within that frame is <dfn>the selected window</dfn>.  The
selected window's buffer is usually the current buffer (except when
<code>set-buffer</code> has been used).  See <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>cursor-in-non-selected-windows</b><var><a name="index-cursor_002din_002dnon_002dselected_002dwindows-1968"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, Emacs displays only one cursor,
in the selected window.  Other windows have no cursor at all. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>For practical purposes, a window exists only while it is displayed in
a frame.  Once removed from the frame, the window is effectively deleted
and should not be used, <em>even though there may still be references
to it</em> from other Lisp objects.  Restoring a saved window configuration
is the only way for a window no longer on the screen to come back to
life.  (See <a href="Deleting-Windows.html#Deleting-Windows">Deleting Windows</a>.)

   <p>Each window has the following attributes:

     <ul>
<li>containing frame

     <li>window height

     <li>window width

     <li>window edges with respect to the screen or frame

     <li>the buffer it displays

     <li>position within the buffer at the upper left of the window

     <li>amount of horizontal scrolling, in columns

     <li>point

     <li>the mark

     <li>how recently the window was selected

     <li>fringe settings

     <li>display margins

     <li>scroll-bar settings
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-multiple-windows-1969"></a>  Users create multiple windows so they can look at several buffers at
once.  Lisp libraries use multiple windows for a variety of reasons, but
most often to display related information.  In Rmail, for example, you
can move through a summary buffer in one window while the other window
shows messages one at a time as they are reached.

   <p>The meaning of &ldquo;window&rdquo; in Emacs is similar to what it means in the
context of general-purpose window systems such as X, but not identical. 
The X Window System places X windows on the screen; Emacs uses one or
more X windows as frames, and subdivides them into
Emacs windows.  When you use Emacs on a character-only terminal, Emacs
treats the whole terminal screen as one frame.

   <p><a name="index-terminal-screen-1970"></a><a name="index-screen-of-terminal-1971"></a><a name="index-tiled-windows-1972"></a>  Most window systems support arbitrarily located overlapping windows. 
In contrast, Emacs windows are <dfn>tiled</dfn>; they never overlap, and
together they fill the whole screen or frame.  Because of the way in
which Emacs creates new windows and resizes them, not all conceivable
tilings of windows on an Emacs frame are actually possible. 
See <a href="Splitting-Windows.html#Splitting-Windows">Splitting Windows</a>, and <a href="Size-of-Window.html#Size-of-Window">Size of Window</a>.

   <p>See <a href="Display.html#Display">Display</a>, for information on how the contents of the
window's buffer are displayed in the window.

<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a window.
