<h4 class="subsection">32.19.12 Why Text Properties are not Intervals</h4>

<p><a name="index-intervals-2636"></a>
  Some editors that support adding attributes to text in the buffer do
so by letting the user specify &ldquo;intervals&rdquo; within the text, and adding
the properties to the intervals.  Those editors permit the user or the
programmer to determine where individual intervals start and end.  We
deliberately provided a different sort of interface in Emacs Lisp to
avoid certain paradoxical behavior associated with text modification.

   <p>If the actual subdivision into intervals is meaningful, that means you
can distinguish between a buffer that is just one interval with a
certain property, and a buffer containing the same text subdivided into
two intervals, both of which have that property.

   <p>Suppose you take the buffer with just one interval and kill part of
the text.  The text remaining in the buffer is one interval, and the
copy in the kill ring (and the undo list) becomes a separate interval. 
Then if you yank back the killed text, you get two intervals with the
same properties.  Thus, editing does not preserve the distinction
between one interval and two.

   <p>Suppose we &ldquo;fix&rdquo; this problem by coalescing the two intervals when
the text is inserted.  That works fine if the buffer originally was a
single interval.  But suppose instead that we have two adjacent
intervals with the same properties, and we kill the text of one interval
and yank it back.  The same interval-coalescence feature that rescues
the other case causes trouble in this one: after yanking, we have just
one interval.  One again, editing does not preserve the distinction
between one interval and two.

   <p>Insertion of text at the border between intervals also raises
questions that have no satisfactory answer.

   <p>However, it is easy to arrange for editing to behave consistently for
questions of the form, &ldquo;What are the properties of this character?&rdquo;
So we have decided these are the only questions that make sense; we have
not implemented asking questions about where intervals start or end.

   <p>In practice, you can usually use the text property search functions in
place of explicit interval boundaries.  You can think of them as finding
the boundaries of intervals, assuming that intervals are always
coalesced whenever possible.  See <a href="Property-Search.html#Property-Search">Property Search</a>.

   <p>Emacs also provides explicit intervals as a presentation feature; see
<a href="Overlays.html#Overlays">Overlays</a>.
