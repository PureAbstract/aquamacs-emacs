<h4 class="subsection">32.8.5 Low-Level Kill Ring</h4>

<p>These functions and variables provide access to the kill ring at a
lower level, but still convenient for use in Lisp programs, because they
take care of interaction with window system selections
(see <a href="Window-System-Selections.html#Window-System-Selections">Window System Selections</a>).

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>current-kill</b><var> n &amp;optional do-not-move<a name="index-current_002dkill-2561"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The function <code>current-kill</code> rotates the yanking pointer, which
designates the &ldquo;front&rdquo; of the kill ring, by <var>n</var> places (from newer
kills to older ones), and returns the text at that place in the ring.

        <p>If the optional second argument <var>do-not-move</var> is non-<code>nil</code>,
then <code>current-kill</code> doesn't alter the yanking pointer; it just
returns the <var>n</var>th kill, counting from the current yanking pointer.

        <p>If <var>n</var> is zero, indicating a request for the latest kill,
<code>current-kill</code> calls the value of
<code>interprogram-paste-function</code> (documented below) before
consulting the kill ring.  If that value is a function and calling it
returns a string or a list of several string, <code>current-kill</code>
pushes the strings onto the kill ring and returns the first string. 
It also sets the yanking pointer to point to the kill-ring entry of
the first string returned by <code>interprogram-paste-function</code>,
regardless of the value of <var>do-not-move</var>.  Otherwise,
<code>current-kill</code> does not treat a zero value for <var>n</var> specially:
it returns the entry pointed at by the yanking pointer and does not
move the yanking pointer. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>kill-new</b><var> string &amp;optional replace yank-handler<a name="index-kill_002dnew-2562"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function pushes the text <var>string</var> onto the kill ring and
makes the yanking pointer point to it.  It discards the oldest entry
if appropriate.  It also invokes the value of
<code>interprogram-cut-function</code> (see below).

        <p>If <var>replace</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then <code>kill-new</code> replaces the
first element of the kill ring with <var>string</var>, rather than pushing
<var>string</var> onto the kill ring.

        <p>If <var>yank-handler</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this puts that value onto
the string of killed text, as a <code>yank-handler</code> property. 
See <a href="Yanking.html#Yanking">Yanking</a>.  Note that if <var>yank-handler</var> is <code>nil</code>, then
<code>kill-new</code> copies any <code>yank-handler</code> properties present on
<var>string</var> onto the kill ring, as it does with other text properties. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>kill-append</b><var> string before-p &amp;optional yank-handler<a name="index-kill_002dappend-2563"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function appends the text <var>string</var> to the first entry in the
kill ring and makes the yanking pointer point to the combined entry. 
Normally <var>string</var> goes at the end of the entry, but if
<var>before-p</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it goes at the beginning.  This
function also invokes the value of <code>interprogram-cut-function</code>
(see below).  This handles <var>yank-handler</var> just like
<code>kill-new</code>, except that if <var>yank-handler</var> is different from
the <code>yank-handler</code> property of the first entry of the kill ring,
<code>kill-append</code> pushes the concatenated string onto the kill ring,
instead of replacing the original first entry with it. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>interprogram-paste-function</b><var><a name="index-interprogram_002dpaste_002dfunction-2564"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable provides a way of transferring killed text from other
programs, when you are using a window system.  Its value should be
<code>nil</code> or a function of no arguments.

        <p>If the value is a function, <code>current-kill</code> calls it to get the
&ldquo;most recent kill.&rdquo;  If the function returns a non-<code>nil</code> value,
then that value is used as the &ldquo;most recent kill.&rdquo;  If it returns
<code>nil</code>, then the front of the kill ring is used.

        <p>To facilitate support for window systems that support multiple
selections, this function may also return a list of strings.  In that
case, the first string is used as the &ldquo;most recent kill&rdquo;, and all
the other strings are pushed onto the kill ring, for easy access by
<code>yank-pop</code>.

        <p>The normal use of this function is to get the window system's primary
selection as the most recent kill, even if the selection belongs to
another application.  See <a href="Window-System-Selections.html#Window-System-Selections">Window System Selections</a>.  However, if
the selection was provided by the current Emacs session, this function
should return <code>nil</code>.  (If it is hard to tell whether Emacs or
some other program provided the selection, it should be good enough to
use <code>string=</code> to compare it with the last text Emacs provided.) 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>interprogram-cut-function</b><var><a name="index-interprogram_002dcut_002dfunction-2565"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable provides a way of communicating killed text to other
programs, when you are using a window system.  Its value should be
<code>nil</code> or a function of one required and one optional argument.

        <p>If the value is a function, <code>kill-new</code> and <code>kill-append</code> call
it with the new first element of the kill ring as the first argument. 
The second, optional, argument has the same meaning as the <var>push</var>
argument to <code>x-set-cut-buffer</code> (see <a href="Definition-of-x_002dset_002dcut_002dbuffer.html#Definition-of-x_002dset_002dcut_002dbuffer">Definition of x-set-cut-buffer</a>) and only affects the second and later cut buffers.

        <p>The normal use of this function is to set the window system's primary
selection (and first cut buffer) from the newly killed text. 
See <a href="Window-System-Selections.html#Window-System-Selections">Window System Selections</a>.
