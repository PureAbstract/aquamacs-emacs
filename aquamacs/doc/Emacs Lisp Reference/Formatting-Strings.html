<h3 class="section">4.7 Formatting Strings</h3>

<p><a name="index-formatting-strings-251"></a><a name="index-strings_002c-formatting-them-252"></a>
  <dfn>Formatting</dfn> means constructing a string by substitution of
computed values at various places in a constant string.  This constant string
controls how the other values are printed, as well as where they appear;
it is called a <dfn>format string</dfn>.

   <p>Formatting is often useful for computing messages to be displayed.  In
fact, the functions <code>message</code> and <code>error</code> provide the same
formatting feature described here; they differ from <code>format</code> only
in how they use the result of formatting.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>format</b><var> string &amp;rest objects<a name="index-format-253"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns a new string that is made by copying
<var>string</var> and then replacing any format specification
in the copy with encodings of the corresponding <var>objects</var>.  The
arguments <var>objects</var> are the computed values to be formatted.

        <p>The characters in <var>string</var>, other than the format specifications,
are copied directly into the output, including their text properties,
if any. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007b_0025_007d-in-format-254"></a><a name="index-format-specification-255"></a>  A format specification is a sequence of characters beginning with a
`<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>'.  Thus, if there is a `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>' in <var>string</var>, the
<code>format</code> function replaces it with the printed representation of
one of the values to be formatted (one of the arguments <var>objects</var>). 
For example:

<pre class="example">     (format "The value of fill-column is %d." fill-column)
          =&gt; "The value of fill-column is 72."
</pre>
   <p>Since <code>format</code> interprets `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>' characters as format
specifications, you should <em>never</em> pass an arbitrary string as
the first argument.  This is particularly true when the string is
generated by some Lisp code.  Unless the string is <em>known</em> to
never include any `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>' characters, pass <code>"%s"</code>, described
below, as the first argument, and the string as the second, like this:

<pre class="example">       (format "%s" <var>arbitrary-string</var>)
</pre>
   <p>If <var>string</var> contains more than one format specification, the
format specifications correspond to successive values from
<var>objects</var>.  Thus, the first format specification in <var>string</var>
uses the first such value, the second format specification uses the
second such value, and so on.  Any extra format specifications (those
for which there are no corresponding values) cause an error.  Any
extra values to be formatted are ignored.

   <p>Certain format specifications require values of particular types.  If
you supply a value that doesn't fit the requirements, an error is
signaled.

   <p>Here is a table of valid format specifications:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>'<dd>Replace the specification with the printed representation of the object,
made without quoting (that is, using <code>princ</code>, not
<code>prin1</code>&mdash;see <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>).  Thus, strings are represented
by their contents alone, with no `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' characters, and symbols appear
without `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' characters.

     <p>If the object is a string, its text properties are
copied into the output.  The text properties of the `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' itself
are also copied, but those of the object take priority.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%S</span></samp>'<dd>Replace the specification with the printed representation of the object,
made with quoting (that is, using <code>prin1</code>&mdash;see <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>).  Thus, strings are enclosed in `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' characters, and
`<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>' characters appear where necessary before special characters.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-integer-to-octal-256"></a>Replace the specification with the base-eight representation of an
integer.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>'<dd>Replace the specification with the base-ten representation of an
integer.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%x</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%X</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-integer-to-hexadecimal-257"></a>Replace the specification with the base-sixteen representation of an
integer.  `<samp><span class="samp">%x</span></samp>' uses lower case and `<samp><span class="samp">%X</span></samp>' uses upper case.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%c</span></samp>'<dd>Replace the specification with the character which is the value given.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>'<dd>Replace the specification with the exponential notation for a floating
point number.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>'<dd>Replace the specification with the decimal-point notation for a floating
point number.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>'<dd>Replace the specification with notation for a floating point number,
using either exponential notation or decimal-point notation, whichever
is shorter.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>'<dd>Replace the specification with a single `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>'.  This format
specification is unusual in that it does not use a value.  For example,
<code>(format "%% %d" 30)</code> returns <code>"% 30"</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>Any other format character results in an `<samp><span class="samp">Invalid format
operation</span></samp>' error.

   <p>Here are several examples:

<pre class="example">     (format "The name of this buffer is %s." (buffer-name))
          =&gt; "The name of this buffer is strings.texi."
     
     (format "The buffer object prints as %s." (current-buffer))
          =&gt; "The buffer object prints as strings.texi."
     
     (format "The octal value of %d is %o,
              and the hex value is %x." 18 18 18)
          =&gt; "The octal value of 18 is 22,
              and the hex value is 12."
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-field-width-258"></a><a name="index-padding-259"></a>  A specification can have a <dfn>width</dfn>, which is a signed decimal
number between the `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>' and the specification character.  If the
printed representation of the object contains fewer characters than
this width, <code>format</code> extends it with padding.  The padding goes
on the left if the width is positive (or starts with zero) and on the
right if the width is negative.  The padding character is normally a
space, but it's `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' if the width starts with a zero.

   <p>Some of these conventions are ignored for specification characters
for which they do not make sense.  That is, `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%S</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">%c</span></samp>' accept a width starting with 0, but still pad with
<em>spaces</em> on the left.  Also, `<samp><span class="samp">%%</span></samp>' accepts a width, but
ignores it.  Here are some examples of padding:

<pre class="example">     (format "%06d is padded on the left with zeros" 123)
          =&gt; "000123 is padded on the left with zeros"
     
     (format "%-6d is padded on the right" 123)
          =&gt; "123    is padded on the right"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the width is too small, <code>format</code> does not truncate the
object's printed representation.  Thus, you can use a width to specify
a minimum spacing between columns with no risk of losing information.

   <p>In the following three examples, `<samp><span class="samp">%7s</span></samp>' specifies a minimum
width of 7.  In the first case, the string inserted in place of
`<samp><span class="samp">%7s</span></samp>' has only 3 letters, it needs 4 blank spaces as padding.  In
the second case, the string <code>"specification"</code> is 13 letters wide
but is not truncated.  In the third case, the padding is on the right.

<pre class="smallexample">     (format "The word `%7s' actually has %d letters in it."
             "foo" (length "foo"))
          =&gt; "The word `    foo' actually has 3 letters in it."
     
     (format "The word `%7s' actually has %d letters in it."
             "specification" (length "specification"))
          =&gt; "The word `specification' actually has 13 letters in it."
     
     (format "The word `%-7s' actually has %d letters in it."
             "foo" (length "foo"))
          =&gt; "The word `foo    ' actually has 3 letters in it."
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-precision-in-format-specifications-260"></a>  All the specification characters allow an optional <dfn>precision</dfn>
before the character (after the width, if present).  The precision is
a decimal-point `<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>' followed by a digit-string.  For the
floating-point specifications (`<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>'), the
precision specifies how many decimal places to show; if zero, the
decimal-point itself is also omitted.  For `<samp><span class="samp">%s</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">%S</span></samp>',
the precision truncates the string to the given width, so `<samp><span class="samp">%.3s</span></samp>'
shows only the first three characters of the representation for
<var>object</var>.  Precision has no effect for other specification
characters.

   <p><a name="index-flags-in-format-specifications-261"></a>  Immediately after the `<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>' and before the optional width and
precision, you can put certain &ldquo;flag&rdquo; characters.

   <p>`<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' as a flag inserts a plus sign before a positive number, so
that it always has a sign.  A space character as flag inserts a space
before a positive number.  (Otherwise, positive numbers start with the
first digit.)  Either of these two flags ensures that positive numbers
and negative numbers use the same number of columns.  These flags are
ignored except for `<samp><span class="samp">%d</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>', and if
both flags are used, the `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' takes precedence.

   <p>The flag `<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' specifies an &ldquo;alternate form&rdquo; which depends on
the format in use.  For `<samp><span class="samp">%o</span></samp>' it ensures that the result begins
with a `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>'.  For `<samp><span class="samp">%x</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">%X</span></samp>', it prefixes the result
with `<samp><span class="samp">0x</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">0X</span></samp>'.  For `<samp><span class="samp">%e</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">%f</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">%g</span></samp>',
the `<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' flag means include a decimal point even if the precision
is zero.
