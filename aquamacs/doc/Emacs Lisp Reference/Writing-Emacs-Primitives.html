<h3 class="appendixsec">E.5 Writing Emacs Primitives</h3>

<p><a name="index-primitive-function-internals-3883"></a><a name="index-writing-Emacs-primitives-3884"></a>
  Lisp primitives are Lisp functions implemented in C.  The details of
interfacing the C function so that Lisp can call it are handled by a few
C macros.  The only way to really understand how to write new C code is
to read the source, but we can explain some things here.

   <p>An example of a special form is the definition of <code>or</code>, from
<samp><span class="file">eval.c</span></samp>.  (An ordinary function would have the same general
appearance.)

   <p><a name="index-garbage-collection-protection-3885"></a>
<pre class="smallexample">     DEFUN ("or", For, Sor, 0, UNEVALLED, 0,
       doc: /* Eval args until one of them yields non-nil, then return that
     value. The remaining args are not evalled at all.
     If all args return nil, return nil.
     usage: (or CONDITIONS ...)  */)
       (args)
          Lisp_Object args;
     {
       register Lisp_Object val = Qnil;
       struct gcpro gcpro1;
     
       GCPRO1 (args);
     
       while (CONSP (args))
         {
           val = Feval (XCAR (args));
           if (!NILP (val))
             break;
           args = XCDR (args);
         }
     
       UNGCPRO;
       return val;
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bDEFUN_007d_002c-C-macro-to-define-Lisp-primitives-3886"></a>  Let's start with a precise explanation of the arguments to the
<code>DEFUN</code> macro.  Here is a template for them:

<pre class="example">     DEFUN (<var>lname</var>, <var>fname</var>, <var>sname</var>, <var>min</var>, <var>max</var>, <var>interactive</var>, <var>doc</var>)
</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><var>lname</var><dd>This is the name of the Lisp symbol to define as the function name; in
the example above, it is <code>or</code>.

     <br><dt><var>fname</var><dd>This is the C function name for this function.  This is
the name that is used in C code for calling the function.  The name is,
by convention, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; prepended to the Lisp name, with all dashes
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;) in the Lisp name changed to underscores.  Thus, to call this
function from C code, call <code>For</code>.  Remember that the arguments must
be of type <code>Lisp_Object</code>; various macros and functions for creating
values of type <code>Lisp_Object</code> are declared in the file
<samp><span class="file">lisp.h</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><var>sname</var><dd>This is a C variable name to use for a structure that holds the data for
the subr object that represents the function in Lisp.  This structure
conveys the Lisp symbol name to the initialization routine that will
create the symbol and store the subr object as its definition.  By
convention, this name is always <var>fname</var> with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; replaced with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><var>min</var><dd>This is the minimum number of arguments that the function requires.  The
function <code>or</code> allows a minimum of zero arguments.

     <br><dt><var>max</var><dd>This is the maximum number of arguments that the function accepts, if
there is a fixed maximum.  Alternatively, it can be <code>UNEVALLED</code>,
indicating a special form that receives unevaluated arguments, or
<code>MANY</code>, indicating an unlimited number of evaluated arguments (the
equivalent of <code>&amp;rest</code>).  Both <code>UNEVALLED</code> and <code>MANY</code> are
macros.  If <var>max</var> is a number, it may not be less than <var>min</var> and
it may not be greater than eight.

     <br><dt><var>interactive</var><dd>This is an interactive specification, a string such as might be used as
the argument of <code>interactive</code> in a Lisp function.  In the case of
<code>or</code>, it is 0 (a null pointer), indicating that <code>or</code> cannot be
called interactively.  A value of <code>""</code> indicates a function that
should receive no arguments when called interactively.  If the value
begins with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo;, the string is evaluated as a Lisp form.

     <br><dt><var>doc</var><dd>This is the documentation string.  It uses C comment syntax rather
than C string syntax because comment syntax requires nothing special
to include multiple lines.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">doc:</span></samp>&rsquo; identifies the comment
that follows as the documentation string.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*/</span></samp>&rsquo;
delimiters that begin and end the comment are not part of the
documentation string.

     <p>If the last line of the documentation string begins with the keyword
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">usage:</span></samp>&rsquo;, the rest of the line is treated as the argument list
for documentation purposes.  This way, you can use different argument
names in the documentation string from the ones used in the C code. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">usage:</span></samp>&rsquo; is required if the function has an unlimited number of
arguments.

     <p>All the usual rules for documentation strings in Lisp code
(see <a href="Documentation-Tips.html#Documentation-Tips">Documentation Tips</a>) apply to C code documentation strings
too. 
</dl>

   <p>After the call to the <code>DEFUN</code> macro, you must write the argument
name list that every C function must have, followed by ordinary C
declarations for the arguments.  For a function with a fixed maximum
number of arguments, declare a C argument for each Lisp argument, and
give them all type <code>Lisp_Object</code>.  When a Lisp function has no
upper limit on the number of arguments, its implementation in C actually
receives exactly two arguments: the first is the number of Lisp
arguments, and the second is the address of a block containing their
values.  They have types <code>int</code> and <code>Lisp_Object&nbsp;*</code><!-- /@w -->.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bGCPRO_007d-and-_0040code_007bUNGCPRO_007d-3887"></a><a name="index-protect-C-variables-from-garbage-collection-3888"></a>  Within the function <code>For</code> itself, note the use of the macros
<code>GCPRO1</code> and <code>UNGCPRO</code>.  <code>GCPRO1</code> is used to
&ldquo;protect&rdquo; a variable from garbage collection&mdash;to inform the garbage
collector that it must look in that variable and regard its contents
as an accessible object.  GC protection is necessary whenever you call
<code>Feval</code> or anything that can directly or indirectly call
<code>Feval</code>.  At such a time, any Lisp object that this function may
refer to again must be protected somehow.

   <p>It suffices to ensure that at least one pointer to each object is
GC-protected; that way, the object cannot be recycled, so all pointers
to it remain valid.  Thus, a particular local variable can do without
protection if it is certain that the object it points to will be
preserved by some other pointer (such as another local variable which
has a <code>GCPRO</code>)<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Otherwise, the local
variable needs a <code>GCPRO</code>.

   <p>The macro <code>GCPRO1</code> protects just one local variable.  If you
want to protect two variables, use <code>GCPRO2</code> instead; repeating
<code>GCPRO1</code> will not work.  Macros <code>GCPRO3</code>, <code>GCPRO4</code>,
<code>GCPRO5</code>, and <code>GCPRO6</code> also exist.  All these macros
implicitly use local variables such as <code>gcpro1</code>; you must declare
these explicitly, with type <code>struct gcpro</code>.  Thus, if you use
<code>GCPRO2</code>, you must declare <code>gcpro1</code> and <code>gcpro2</code>. 
Alas, we can't explain all the tricky details here.

   <p><code>UNGCPRO</code> cancels the protection of the variables that are
protected in the current function.  It is necessary to do this
explicitly.

   <p>Built-in functions that take a variable number of arguments actually
accept two arguments at the C level: the number of Lisp arguments, and
a <code>Lisp_Object *</code> pointer to a C vector containing those Lisp
arguments.  This C vector may be part of a Lisp vector, but it need
not be.  The responsibility for using <code>GCPRO</code> to protect the Lisp
arguments from GC if necessary rests with the caller in this case,
since the caller allocated or found the storage for them.

   <p>You must not use C initializers for static or global variables unless
the variables are never written once Emacs is dumped.  These variables
with initializers are allocated in an area of memory that becomes
read-only (on certain operating systems) as a result of dumping Emacs. 
See <a href="Pure-Storage.html#Pure-Storage">Pure Storage</a>.

   <p>Do not use static variables within functions&mdash;place all static
variables at top level in the file.  This is necessary because Emacs on
some operating systems defines the keyword <code>static</code> as a null
macro.  (This definition is used because those systems put all variables
declared static in a place that becomes read-only after dumping, whether
they have initializers or not.)

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bdefsubr_007d_002c-Lisp-symbol-for-a-primitive-3889"></a>  Defining the C function is not enough to make a Lisp primitive
available; you must also create the Lisp symbol for the primitive and
store a suitable subr object in its function cell.  The code looks like
this:

<pre class="example">     defsubr (&amp;<var>subr-structure-name</var>);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here <var>subr-structure-name</var> is the name you used as the third
argument to <code>DEFUN</code>.

   <p>If you add a new primitive to a file that already has Lisp primitives
defined in it, find the function (near the end of the file) named
<code>syms_of_</code><var>something</var>, and add the call to <code>defsubr</code>
there.  If the file doesn't have this function, or if you create a new
file, add to it a <code>syms_of_</code><var>filename</var> (e.g.,
<code>syms_of_myfile</code>).  Then find the spot in <samp><span class="file">emacs.c</span></samp> where all
of these functions are called, and add a call to
<code>syms_of_</code><var>filename</var> there.

   <p><a name="Defining-Lisp-variables-in-C"></a><a name="index-byte_002dboolean_002dvars-3890"></a><a name="index-defining-Lisp-variables-in-C-3891"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bDEFVAR_005fINT_007d_002c-_0040code_007bDEFVAR_005fLISP_007d_002c-_0040code_007bDEFVAR_005fBOOL_007d-3892"></a>  The function <code>syms_of_</code><var>filename</var> is also the place to define
any C variables that are to be visible as Lisp variables. 
<code>DEFVAR_LISP</code> makes a C variable of type <code>Lisp_Object</code> visible
in Lisp.  <code>DEFVAR_INT</code> makes a C variable of type <code>int</code>
visible in Lisp with a value that is always an integer. 
<code>DEFVAR_BOOL</code> makes a C variable of type <code>int</code> visible in Lisp
with a value that is either <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code>.  Note that variables
defined with <code>DEFVAR_BOOL</code> are automatically added to the list
<code>byte-boolean-vars</code> used by the byte compiler.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bstaticpro_007d_002c-protection-from-GC-3893"></a>  If you define a file-scope C variable of type <code>Lisp_Object</code>,
you must protect it from garbage-collection by calling <code>staticpro</code>
in <code>syms_of_</code><var>filename</var>, like this:

<pre class="example">     staticpro (&amp;<var>variable</var>);
</pre>
   <p>Here is another example function, with more complicated arguments. 
This comes from the code in <samp><span class="file">window.c</span></samp>, and it demonstrates the use
of macros and functions to manipulate Lisp objects.

<pre class="smallexample">     DEFUN ("coordinates-in-window-p", Fcoordinates_in_window_p,
       Scoordinates_in_window_p, 2, 2,
       "xSpecify coordinate pair: \nXExpression which evals to window: ",
       "Return non-nil if COORDINATES is in WINDOW.\n\
     COORDINATES is a cons of the form (X . Y), X and Y being distances\n\
     ...
     If they are on the border between WINDOW and its right sibling,\n\
        `vertical-line' is returned.")
       (coordinates, window)
          register Lisp_Object coordinates, window;
     {
       int x, y;
     
       CHECK_LIVE_WINDOW (window, 0);
       CHECK_CONS (coordinates, 1);
       x = XINT (Fcar (coordinates));
       y = XINT (Fcdr (coordinates));
     
       switch (coordinates_in_window (XWINDOW (window), &amp;x, &amp;y))
         {
         case 0:			/* NOT in window at all. */
           return Qnil;
     
         case 1:			/* In text part of window. */
           return Fcons (make_number (x), make_number (y));
     
         case 2:			/* In mode line of window. */
           return Qmode_line;
     
         case 3:			/* On right border of window.  */
           return Qvertical_line;
     
         default:
           abort ();
         }
     }
</pre>
   <p>Note that C code cannot call functions by name unless they are defined
in C.  The way to call a function written in Lisp is to use
<code>Ffuncall</code>, which embodies the Lisp function <code>funcall</code>.  Since
the Lisp function <code>funcall</code> accepts an unlimited number of
arguments, in C it takes two: the number of Lisp-level arguments, and a
one-dimensional array containing their values.  The first Lisp-level
argument is the Lisp function to call, and the rest are the arguments to
pass to it.  Since <code>Ffuncall</code> can call the evaluator, you must
protect pointers from garbage collection around the call to
<code>Ffuncall</code>.

   <p>The C functions <code>call0</code>, <code>call1</code>, <code>call2</code>, and so on,
provide handy ways to call a Lisp function conveniently with a fixed
number of arguments.  They work by calling <code>Ffuncall</code>.

   <p><samp><span class="file">eval.c</span></samp> is a very good file to look through for examples;
<samp><span class="file">lisp.h</span></samp> contains the definitions for some important macros and
functions.

   <p>If you define a function which is side-effect free, update the code
in <samp><span class="file">byte-opt.el</span></samp> which binds <code>side-effect-free-fns</code> and
<code>side-effect-and-error-free-fns</code> so that the compiler optimizer
knows about it.
