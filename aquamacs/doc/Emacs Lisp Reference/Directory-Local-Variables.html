<h3 class="section">11.12 Directory Local Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-directory-local-variables-650"></a>
  A directory can specify local variable values common to all files in
that directory; Emacs uses these to create buffer-local bindings for
those variables in buffers visiting any file in that directory.  This
is useful when the files in the directory belong to some <dfn>project</dfn>
and therefore share the same local variables.

   <p>There are two different methods for specifying directory local
variables: by putting them in a special file, or by defining a
<dfn>project class</dfn> for that directory.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Constant: <b>dir-locals-file</b><var><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dfile-651"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This constant is the name of the file where Emacs expects to find the
directory-local variables.  The name of the file is
<samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  A file by that name in a directory causes Emacs to apply its
settings to any file in that directory or any of its subdirectories. 
If some of the subdirectories have their own <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp>
files, Emacs uses the settings from the deepest file it finds starting
from the file's directory and moving up the directory tree.  The file
specifies local variables as a specially formatted list; see
<a href="../emacs/Directory-Variables.html#Directory-Variables">Per-directory Local Variables</a>, for more details. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>hack-dir-local-variables</b><var><a name="index-hack_002ddir_002dlocal_002dvariables-652"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function reads the <code>.dir-locals.el</code> file and stores the
directory-local variables in <code>file-local-variables-alist</code> that is
local to the buffer visiting any file in the directory, without
applying them.  It also stores the directory-local settings in
<code>dir-locals-class-alist</code>, where it defines a special class for
the directory in which <samp><span class="file">.dir-locals.el</span></samp> file was found.  This
function works by calling <code>dir-locals-set-class-variables</code> and
<code>dir-locals-set-directory-class</code>, described below. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>dir-locals-set-class-variables</b><var> class variables<a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dset_002dclass_002dvariables-653"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function defines a set of variable settings for the named
<var>class</var>, which is a symbol.  You can later assign the class to one
or more directories, and Emacs will apply those variable settings to
all files in those directories.  The list in <var>variables</var> can be of
one of the two forms: <code>(</code><var>major-mode</var><code> . </code><var>alist</var><code>)</code> or
<code>(</code><var>directory</var><code> . </code><var>list</var><code>)</code>.  With the first form, if the
file's buffer turns on a mode that is derived from <var>major-mode</var>,
then the all the variables in the associated <var>alist</var> are applied;
<var>alist</var> should be of the form <code>(</code><var>name</var><code> . </code><var>value</var><code>)</code>. 
A special value <code>nil</code> for <var>major-mode</var> means the settings are
applicable to any mode.

        <p>With the second form of <var>variables</var>, if <var>directory</var> is the
initial substring of the file's directory, then <var>list</var> is applied
recursively by following the above rules; <var>list</var> should be of one
of the two forms accepted by this function in <var>variables</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>dir-locals-set-directory-class</b><var> directory class<a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dset_002ddirectory_002dclass-654"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function assigns <var>class</var> to all the files in <code>directory</code>
and its subdirectories.  Thereafter, all the variable settings
specified for <var>class</var> will be applied to any visited file in
<var>directory</var> and its children.  <var>class</var> must have been already
defined by <code>dir-locals-set-class-variables</code>
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>dir-locals-class-alist</b><var><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002dclass_002dalist-655"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This alist holds the class symbols and the associated variable
settings.  It is updated by <code>dir-locals-set-class-variables</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>dir-locals-directory-cache</b><var><a name="index-dir_002dlocals_002ddirectory_002dcache-656"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This alist holds directory names, their assigned class names, and
modification times of the associated directory local variables file. 
It is updated by <code>dir-locals-set-directory-class</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> 
The MS-DOS version of Emacs uses <samp><span class="file">_dir-locals.el</span></samp> instead, due to
limitations of the DOS filesystems.
