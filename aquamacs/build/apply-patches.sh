# The patches here are specified separately so their order can be defined.

# It might also be useful(?) to touch a .applied file in the patches
# directory to indicate which patches have been applied correctly.
# Then people could re-run apply-patches.sh. You could compare dates
# and apply the patch file if it were newer than the .applied file
# in case you picked up changes to the patch file from CVS.
