	* Aquamacs Emacs

	developed by David Reitter 
	documentation by Kevin Walzer 
	based on GNU Emacs
	
	GNU Emacs is due to Richard M. Stallman and many others.
	GNU Emacs was ported to the Mac by Andrew Choi and many others.


CVS Version

	* Meta/Option key: New minor modes allow users of various
	keyboard layouts (German, French, Italian, GB/US) to use the
	Option key as Meta modifier under Emacs (as it is the
	default), but still be able to input characters such as [ ] {
	} | and @. This works for common characters (not all). Some
	rarely used Emacs key bindings such as M-4 on Italian
	keyboards are overridden by these modes. Activate them via the
	Options menu ("Option Key"), or with M-x
	emulate-mac-french-keyboard-mode (substitute 'french' with
	a keyboard layout in lower case).
	The following keyboard layouts are known

	German, Italian, French, US, British

	You may define your own mappings. (Please publish them.)
	
	* Bug reporting: Use standard GNU Emacs bug reporting facility
 	(but go through the mail client when necessary.)

	* One-Buffer-One-Frame: Change in the decision-making process
	about when to show a buffer in a new frame. Generally, all buffers
	with names in *'s (such as *vc*) will be shown in the same
	frame (as directed by `obof-same-frame-regexps'), with the
	exception of Messages, Help and Customize buffers (as listed in
	`obof-other-frame-regexps'). This means that more buffers will
	open as a "small" window inside the current frame. Please report
	back to us in case you have any unwanted results with this.
	
   Bugfixes:

	* Browsing a URL (as in Help menu functions, mouse clicks in Gnus
	etc. could fail in rare circumstances.

	* Tcsh environments will be correctly imported into Aquamacs now.

	* AUCTeX and RSS documentation (info) are now included.

	* Avoid the Dock when opening frames 

	* Up/down movements of the cursor: subtle tweak (jumping to
	temporary goal column only in series of up/down movements.)
 
2005-01-02 Version 0.9.7

	* SUMMARY: New functions: Mac-style printing with preview, export
	to PDF and HTML, spelling suggestions with flyspell, New buffer in
	mode / change major mode menus, a context menu (right mouse
	click), speed improvements, nXML and AUCTeX included, improved
	text display (international characters and proportional fonts),
	more compatibility with the core GNU Emacs, an updated Emacs
	Manual, "wrong command-p" bug fixed and much more.

	
	* Printing: Aquamacs now supports full What-you-see-is-what-
	you-get printing. Choose 'Preview and Print' from the File menu,
	and the current buffer (or the current region, if one is marked)
	is typeset using the color theme and the syntax coloring that is
	active. You can then preview or print it with the standard Mac OS
	X printing dialogs, selecting a standard Mac printer. (Output to
	US Letter format only at this point. Sorry!)

	* Export to PDF and HTML: The current buffer (or a region if
	selected) can now be exported to a PDF or HTML file. Syntax
	coloring (and the chosen color theme except for the background
	color) are respected.
	
	* LaTeX: Aquamacs now comes with the latest version of
	AUCTeX, which will allow you to most comfortably edit LaTeX source
	code and even preview some of the results (e.g. formulas) directly
	in your document.  No need to install an additional AUCTeX
	package. 	AUCTeX already works out-of-the box.

	It is recommended that you remove any previous installations of
	AUCTeX. 
	
	* nXML: Edit XML code more comfortably with the included
	nxml-mode. It validates the document as you type. If you don't
	like the mode, the following in your Preferences.el file will
	bring the old XML mode back:

 	(assq-set-equal "<\\?xml " 'xml-mode 'magic-mode-alist)

	Suggestion from Tim Bray.

	* Speed: Aquamacs is a little faster now when opening new frames,
	when frame appearance themes have been defined. 
	
	* Right-Mouse-clicks in text now bring up a context menu which
	allows you to copy/paste, search the word under the mouse in
	Google or look it up in the system dictionary and switch the buffer.

	* Control-Mouse-click is always mapped to mouse-3 (right mouse
	button) now so Apple mouse and laptop users will consistently get
	the same functionality. To do mouse-2, just hold down the Command
	key while clicking. (This does mouse-yank-at-click, a useful
	functionality that you might be used to from Linux / X11
	machines!)

	* Alt-Mouse-click&drag allows you to select a secondary
	selection. (This used to be on Command-mouse-1-drag.)
	
	* Spelling correction (flyspell) will make suggestions upon
	right-clicking on a misspelled word.

	* Fonts/Display: Aquamacs Emacs can now display an even wider
	range of characters with any font available on OS X. Some
	characters will look nicer.  
	Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu

	* Text Display: Aquamacs now displays text in variable-width fonts
	with much better letter-spacing. It'll look like in other OS X
	apps, and reading and editing long texts is much more fun now.
	Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu

	* Navigation in wrapped lines (not word wrap) is easier now: arrow
	keys will jump to the next visual line, not to the next
	buffer/file line. Also, navigation is visual now for variable
	width fonts like Lucida: jumping up or down moves to roughly the
	same place in the adjacent line going after what's displayed on
	the screen rather than counting characters (jumping to the same
	row number in the next line).  If you don't like the behavior, you
	can turn it off with this code in your Preferences.el / .emacs
	file:

 	(define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap previous-line] 'previous-line)
 	(define-key osx-key-mode-map [remap next-line] 'next-line)

	* Scrolling and setting the point with the mouse has improved:
	`scroll-margin' defaults to 0 now, so scrolling won't happen until
	you've reached the first or last line in the window - except when
	you use the cursor up/down keys (and osx-key-mode is on). Then,
	scrolling takes place a few lines before you reach the
	boundary. You can configure this via Aquamacs' customization
	variable `visual-scroll-margin'.

	* Command-{ comments the line or the region (in programming modes)
	* Command-} uncomments the line or the region (in programming
	modes) 
	* Command-' comments or uncomments (toggling) the line or
	the region (in programming modes)

	* Command-Delete kills (erases) the rest of the current
	line. (Command-Backspace kills the whole line.)
	
	* Filenames with spaces can now be entered without hassle.
	
	* Modifier-Key configuration: Several previously deprecated
	variables have been removed: `mac-reverse-ctrl-meta' and
	'mac-command-key-is-meta'. Use the much simpler, yet
	equally powerful variables `mac-command-modifier', 
	`mac-option-modifier', `mac-control-modifier' and 
	`mac-function-modifier' (experimental) instead.
	Additionally, `mac-pass-option-to-system' is deprecated now:
	instead, set `mac-option-modifier' to nil to reach the same
	effect. The use of the Option menu is recommended. 
	
	To set the Apple key to Meta (not recommended), add this to your
	Preferences.el file:

 	(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)

	* Fn-key can act as Meta. If you have an Fn key on your laptop,
	you can use it as Meta key now. Add this to your Preferences.el
	file:

 	(setq mac-function-modifier 'meta)

	Note that support of the Fn key is experimental. Rare combinations
	may fail on non-English keyboard layouts, and some keys will not
	work correctly in combination with Fn and Shift.
	 
	* Modifier keys such as Command or Shift show up correctly in the
	shortcuts (menu)

	* New-Buffer menu contains many more modes now, such as modes for
	Fortran, ObjectiveC, C++, PHP, CSS, JavaScript...
	You can add your own in the customization variable
	`aquamacs-known-major-modes'. The menu is updated automatically.

	* Change-Buffer-Mode menu (in File menu) allows to change the mode
	of the current buffer to something hopefully more useful.
	
	* Recently used major modes are now displayed in New-Buffer and
	Change-Buffer-Mode menus .
	
	* M-w (kill-ring-save) will now deactivate the mark after saving
	the region, that is deselect the region, just like on standard
	Emacs. Apple-C will not deselect the region, just like it's done
	on the Mac. 

	* Run executables from within Emacs that lie in your PATH as set
	in .bash_profile (or the appropriate shell configuration
	file). Aquamacs will set `exec-path' automatically from PATH.
	We don't add paths to exec-path any more (except one default tetex
	path for AUCTeX).

	* Questions like "Save to file before closing?" will be asked with
	a proper dialog and not with a menu appearing out of nothing - if
	the last action was carried out with the mouse.           

	Thanks to CarbonEmacsJP project for part of this.

	* Info mode: C-h i  will bring up not only up-to-date info nodes
	for Emacs, but also info on installed packages on the system.
 	(unless you have an INFOPATH environment variable set)

	* Mode-specific themes: With a new menu function, you can now
	apply the theme assigned to some other mode, effectively copying
	it over.

	* Mode-specific themes are not applied any more for the major-mode
	of buffers shown in temporary windows inside frames such as the
	*Completions* buffer. This prevents ugly font-switching etc. for
	the whole frame when just a small window is opened inside the frame.

	* New Packages: findr, htmlize, ruby's friends, auctex
 	(latex-mode), nxml-mode, matlab-mode, javascript-mode, 
	
	* Notable Updated external packages: ruby-mode, ruby-*, cabron-font

	* Apple/Command key is now called 'A-' internally because it looks
	like "Apple-" (while it's really the otherwise unused "Alt" key). 
	It used to be "H-" (or: hyper), so change your configuration code
	in case you've defined your own shortcuts.

	* One-Buffer-One-Frame is a minor mode now (called
	one-buffer-one-frame-mode). Use the Options menu (and Save
	Options) to turn it on/off, as before.
	In this minor mode, you have some additional key bindings now:

	C-x B, C-x C-B, C-x S-left, C-x S-right
	they all do the same as their corresponding functions without the
	Shift key, but they will show the buffer that they are switching
	to in the same window, even though one-buffer-one-frame-mode is on.

	The mode has been revised to open fewer extra windows when their
	content is related to a specific frame - for example version
	control checkin comments.
	
	* Manual: The Emacs Manual that comes with Aquamacs (as an Apple
	Help document) has been updated to reflect the basis of Aquamacs,
	namely the upcoming Emacs 22.
	
	* Command-p-Bugfix: For some users, Emacs locked up at random
	times, showing a message like (wrong command-p ...) in the echo
	area of a frame on every input. This bug in the underlying GNU
	Emacs should be fixed now.
	Patches by Yamamoto Mitsuharu, Richard Stallman, et al.
	
	* Bugfix: Aquamacs now correctly remembers the positions of frames
	with specific files, so they open again on the same screen
	position if the file is re-loaded (in the same session, or after
	"Save Options" in the next session).
	* Bugfix: Bookmarks did not work with `one-buffer-one-frame'
	turned on.  
	* Bugfix: Some Show/Hide options weren't saved by
	"Save Options".
	* Bugfix: links from describe-variable/function help buffers to the 
	source files are correct now for the Aquamacs-specific objects
	* Bugfix: Aquamacs works fine now on systems where, in the default
	shell (e.g. via .bash_profile), functions have been defined and
	exported.
	Reported by Terry Jones
	* Bugfix: RefTeX mode does't give constant audio signals (errors) 
	any more in certain situations
	* Bugfix: Allout mode should work again (saving files)
	Reported by Gerry Brush
	Patch by Ken Mannheimer
	
	* Donate: Happy about the new version?  Want further improvements?
	Please donate to the Aquamacs project at http://aquamacs.org -
	Thank you.
	
	
2005-09-29 Version 0.9.6  

	* Input-Methods: Aquamacs now provides extended input methods for 
	Korean, Japanese and Chinese (GB/BIG5). You can select them in 
	the Options menu, under "Aquamacs Multilingual Environment" / 
	"Set Language Environment" - everything is integrated with
	Mule.   

	In order to load more fixed-width fonts suitable for use with
	Asian languages, you may want to load the carbon-font package,
	which is included (but not activated) in Aquamacs. Just add the
	following to the file 
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el:

 	(require 'carbon-font)

	(maintained by  최만수, Mahn-Soo Choi.)
	
	* CSS-Mode fixed. 
	(First reported by Kris Khaira and Michael Jakl.)

	* Dual-head setups (two screens) with one screen on the left, the
	system menu on the right and Aquamacs frames on the left caused
	problems.
	(reported by Otto Karl Florian Diesenbacher)
	
	* osx-key-mode-map can now be changed to modify key
	assignments, in particular those of Apple Command keys
 	(implemented in Emacs as Hyper = H- keys.)
	(reported by William Ziemer)

	* "font-lock-keywords ... void" message used to appear when
	attempting to load a new file. This bug in the underlying GNU
	Emacs has been fixed.

	* Apple-Q and iconized frames: When all frames where iconized and
	one attempted to quit Aquamacs, the application seemed to hang
 	(because it was showing a minibuffer prompt in an iconized frame.)
	
	* Thanks for the donations!
	
2005-08-31  Version 0.9.5b (minor bugfix release)

	* Finder Start: Aquamacs Emacs could sometimes not be assigned as
	default application to open files. Hence, double-clicking files in
	Finder to open Aquamacs didn't work in all cases. Reset
	LaunchServices database after installing Aquamacs as shown below
	in case things don't work right away.
	
	* Application Services: Aquamacs didn't show up as a application
	service ("Open New Buffer with Selection", etc.), or it couldn't
	handle these calls. This should work now. If it doesn't work for
	you, execute the following on the command line in order to reset
	your LaunchServices database.
	
	/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
	
	* Ctrl-Up/Down now skip paragraphs again.

	* Attempt to rectify some problems where error messages
	indicated that "max-lisp-eval-depth" had been exceeded.
	More intelligence on this issue is appreciated. Please file bug
	reports.

	* tcl-mode included in the New Buffers menu.

	* indicate-empty-lines: can be switched off now. Issues with 
	saving the option may remain.

	* Option Key Is Meta: this menu item showed the wrong (opposite)
	state with its check-mark in some cases.
	
	
2005-08-28  Version 0.9.5
	
	* Fonts: Setting the frame font gives a warning now (that the font
	is only set for the current frame), or sets it as default if Frame
	Appearance Themes are off.

	* Keyboard: You can switch the Option key from its Emacs-specific
	Meta meaning to its Mac typical use (composing keys such as ü
	 (Engl. keyboard) or \ (German keyboard) by typing Apple-; -- this
	is equivalent to the Options menu entry "Option key for Meta".

	* Text is now nicely shown a little to the right in windows. In
	the left "fringe", you can see small dots indicating the end of
	the buffer, and a small triangle indicating continued lines. If
	you can't see them, your Frame / default theme overwrites
	it. Select "Options / Frame Appearance Themes / Reset all themes"
	to make the fringes appear.
	(Suggested by Alan Curtis)

	* Soft Word Wrap (longlines mode) now applies to all buffers
	in text modes, not just the current buffer. This is analogous
	to the hard word wrap option in the Options menu. (Note that
	longlines mode doesn't work well with variable-width fonts. As
	in any editor, it will interact unfavorably with text that has
	been hard-wrapped before.)
	
	* BUGFIX: The (Apple Help) manuals work now on systems where tcsh
	is the default shell. 
	(Reported by Arthur Ogus)

	* BUGFIX: customizations file isn't left in a buffer any more when
	saving the options.
	(Reported by Robert Sloan)
	
Version 0.9.5b4:

	* The application is now called Aquamacs Emacs.

	* The menu of Recent Files will abbreviate long paths now.

	* Page-wise scrolling is more reliable, that is, it's really page-wise and
	you can always return to the same line. (Pager package)

	* Better support for editing HTML: HTML-Helper-Mode is included.

	* Emacs Speaks Statistics is included. (Minor glitches with info
	files are known and will be addressed.)

	* Auctex configuration now turns on abbrev-mode and flyspell-mode when
	latex-mode is started (instead of toggling them).
	(reported by Robert Sloan)

	* There's a useful "New" sub-menu (in the File menu) that allows you to open
	a buffer in a specific mode.

	* Changes are displayed upon upgrading Aquamacs.	

	
Version 0.9.5b3:
	
	* Renamed "Option key produces only special characters" to "Option key for
	Meta (not for extra characters)"

	* C-x C-f  (find-file) will bring up a window first before asking for the
	name of the file to be loaded.

	* Files saved with Aquamacs have a nice file icon now

	* The "frame appearance themes" system has been revised. *Messages* now has
	a distinctive colored background. To change this background (or
	the one for *Help* buffers), customize the variable 
	`aquamacs-buffer-specific-frame-themes'. 
	Also, you can turn Frame Appearance Themes on and off with a menu
	item. 
	(Also: fixes for issues introduced in the last beta.)

	* Frame-related functions from File menu are now in Buffers menu.

	* 1on1-* customization variables are gone - most of them were not in working
	order (in Aquamacs) anyways due to the way we were using the
	Oneonone package. This gets rid of quite a bit of doubly
	implemented functionality.

	* Help (Aquamacs Manual) has been revised.

	* Known bug: don't try to create a mode specific theme in latex-mode. It
	may fail...

		
Version 0.9.5b2:

	* Mode-specific themes revised: the full set of parameters coming from 
	color themes is now supported, in addition to the font and toolbar setting.

	* Menu item to delete the mode-specific theme for the current major mode.

	* Option-up/down (if Option is meta) now scroll page-wise.
	
	* (Even) speedier startup.

	* A number of bug-fixes.

	
Version 0.9.5b1:

	* The customization variable aquamacs-auto-frame-parameters allows you to
	turn offmode-specific themes - your frames stay the same, no
	matter what major mode you switch to. 

	* Frame Appearance Themes have a better menu structure now in the Options
	menu. Also, there's a new function "Delete all mode-specific
	themes". 

	* Many menu items are now greyed out (cannot be selected) when no frame is visible.
	
	* Font 'Bitstream vera sans' works again.  	

	* Every Aquamacs frame has a toolbar-button now. Use it to turn the
	toolbar in the given frame on and off. 
	
	* Tool-bar can be turned off (per frame) again. Different defaults for major
	modes are allowed.
	
	* Improvement when working with multiple frames: when no frame is visible,
	Aquamacs no longer raises some other frame as soon as a file is
	loaded.	
	
	* Speedbar works when one-buffer-one-frame ("Open Buffers in Separate
	Frames") is turned off. 

	* Ispell did not work when one-buffer-one-frame was turned on.
	(Reported by Robert Sloan)

	* Startup with arguments -nw (tty / in terminal) revised.
	
	* In particular in TeX mode, Aquamacs tended to give audio signals all the
	time when there were internal exceptions (internal errors signaled) with
	parsing the TeX code. Therefore, we don't ring the bell any more,
	i.e. aquamacs-ring-bell-on-error-flag is nil by default.
	(Reported by Ken Bloom and Andreas Hess)

	* You can now redefine Aquamacs keys like this:
	(define-key osx-key-mode-map [end] 'end-of-line)
	(thanks for reporting: Andreas Hess)
	
	* If the user changes mac-command-modifier, it may be advisable to call
	 (osx-key-reset-mode-map)
	This will ensure that the keymap is updated and Aquamacs installs
	its mac-like keyboard commands (provided you want this.)

	* New frames won't open behind the Dock any more.

	* Emacs Manual updated to 0.9.4 with change log.
	
	* Startup is faster now due to an optimization in loading fonts 
	(thanks: Yamamoto M.) and precompiling some .el files.

	* Error message during version check on startup removed (occurred in
	certain cases where users had upgraded their system.)

	* Exiting view mode (e.g. help) with 'q' deletes the frame instead of
	iconifying it.

	* An error message (harmless) when clicking on "Finish" in customize is gone.

Version 0.9.4:

	* Bug reports contain the subject line that the user entered.

	* No more (delay due to) tramp mode on startup in cases where tramp
	mode had been used before (recentf)

	* Files on externally mounted volumes aren't checked for readability
	any more for exclusion from recent files list.
	(Reported by Bill Clementson)
	
No more warnings when fonts are missing (on startup)

	* Drag&Drop while in minibuffer works again

	* Mouse-2 works again

	* default-major-mode and initial-major-mode are respected now.
	initial-frame-alist is not modified any more.
	Note that other than in any standard Emacs, mode-specific settings
	always take precedence over default-frame-alist (but not over
	initial-frame-alist).
	(Reported by Rick Zaccone, Joe Davison & Peter Dyballa)

	* No more warnings in customization buffers that the values have
	been changed outside customize (for certain variables)

	* Gnus articles (newsreader) open in same frame now

	* Gnus has a useful (free) nntp server set so you can start right
	away

	* Send Email with Sendmail is gone from menu (doesn't usually work
	on  OS X)

	* Fonts corrected: Some glyphs in some fonts turned out wrong when
	in bold or italic. Also, font sizes are correct again (Lucida 14
	is Lucida Grande 14, not 12 or so). The default font size for
	text-mode (and similar ones) is set to Lucida 13 to make up for
	the change.  Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause with
	your default settings.
	(Reported by William Henney)
	
	* Better customization for aquamacs-mode-specific-default-themes

	* The customizations file (customizations.el) doesn't grow any more.
	(Reported by Alastair Rankine.)

	* Various corrections in the Aquamacs Manual

	* Plugin support: All files named site-start.el anywhere in the load-path
	are loaded at startup, before the user's init files are
	loaded. For example, such a file may be placed in
	~/Library/Application Support/Aquamacs Emacs/myPlugin. This
	feature enables support for easily installable plugins.  
	
	* We anticipate shorter startup times in the next release. Stay tuned.

0.9.3a/b

	* fixed "wrong argument type" problem (version check),
	which could occur in new installations or those updated from 0.9.1

	* Monaco 18 font present (suggestion: David M. Cook)

	* Emacs Manual available again.

	* save mac-pass-option-to-system when saving options

SUMMARY: CHANGES IN 0.9.3 SINCE 0.9.1
===========================================

FEATURES AND CHANGES

Running Aquamacs:
	
	* Slightly faster startup.

	* Runs on OS X 10.3.9, 10.4.0 and 10.4.1 - tested.

	* Aquamacs automatically checks for updates and notifies the user
	if there is something new. This function communicates with an
	internet server; it does not transmit any information identifying
	the user. If you would like to know more about what is
	transmitted, use M-x aquamacs-check-version-information. If you
	like to turn this check off, add this to your file
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el:

	(setq aquamacs-version-check-url nil)

	* Adding Emacs packages is easier now: Emacs automatically finds
	packages in subdirectories within the [~]/Library/{Preferences|
	Application Support}/{Emacs|Aquamacs Emacs}/ paths.

	* 	Aquamacs now sets the file creator information of files it
	writes. This helps to open the file from Finder with Emacs when
	you double-click it. Feature can be turned off via customization
	option "aquamacs-set-creator-codes-after-writing-files".  Also,
	Emacs will appear in the Finder's context menu under "Open With"
	for a lot of files that it is commonly used to edit.

	* You can start Aquamacs in a terminal (by running
	/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs) with parameter -nw
	and will show up in the terminal rather than a sa Carbon
	application. Basic file editing and all traditional commands
	work. However, Aquamacs-specific keyboard commands (with the
	Command key) will not work and other functionality may be limited,
	too. Warning: This mode of use, which may break in future
	versions, is not supported by the Aquamacs team.
	
Frame/Window Operations:
	
	* We make sure that the *Completions* buffer (and similar things)
	open as a window inside the frame directly above the Minibuffer,
	and not in a new frame.

	* All newly opened frames open in a somewhat useful position, so
	they're not in the way. (If you don't like this, I suggest you set
	your own static frame positions via "set current theme as default"
	and also add this to your file ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs
	Emacs/Preferences.el:

	(setq smart-frame-positioning-enforce nil)

	* Or, if you would like to go with the default position all the time,
	turn the global minor mode off:

	(smart-frame-positioning-mode nil)

	* PHP-Mode included (M-x php-mode)

	* Ruby-Mode included (M-x ruby-mode)

Fonts:
	
	* Aquamacs should not complain about missing fonts any more when
	you have upgraded from earlier versions and set scalable fonts as
	default fonts for modes or all frames. They get filtered
	automatically.

	* Users with certain setups (cyrillic Lucida Grande) should not get
	a "default font not found" error any more

	* More fonts available now.

	* Monaco is the default font for unknown modes.	
 
Interface:

	* The secondary selection is back: use the Command (Apple) key
	together with clicking/dragging the mouse cursor over text in
	order to select text that is not related to the point
	(cursor). This way, you can select text and then scroll somewhere
	else. Extend your selection with shift-command-mouse1.  To
	copy/cut the text in the secondary selection to the clipboard, use
	Shift-Command-C/X, respectively.

	* Some key-bindings are more like the original Emacs ones--in
	particular M-w, which does kill-ring-save again.  (Idea: Joe
	Davison) Also, Home and End keys work as expected.

	* No more annoying system 'ding' (bell ringing) all the time.  The bell is
	turned off completely except for cases where errors occur (even
	internally), until Emacs developers eliminate the use of the bell
	on user-initiated abort actions (such as ESC ESC ESC when in
	minibuffer, of pressing 'Cancel' in the file selection dialog).
	
	* The toolbar is only displayed in normal frames, but not
	in frames that show help/info buffers. (tool-bar+ and
	aquamacs-tool-bar packages). Turn such toolbars on/off in
	Options/Show/Hide menu.
	
	* The "About Emacs" dialogue has been improved

	* Key combinations with the option key that  involve
	another modifier (that is, ctrl or command) will now work, even
	though simple option combinations are handled by the system to
	produce special characters.

	* The Speedbar is back. Activate in Options/ Show/Hide.

	* The redo function is in the Edit menu now.

	* New buffers (File / New) open in Text Adapt Fill mode now.

	* .save-places and customizations.el don't show up in the recent
	files list any more.

	* auto-save-files (in ~/.emacs.d) are now saved to ~/Library/ Prefs...

	* "Save Place in Files in between sessions" will not generate files
	in the user's home folder any more. Instead, the file goes into
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/ where it belongs.

	* Command-` now cycles between different windows 
	(suggested  by Joseph Kiniry.)

	* Case-insensitive search option has gone into "search" submenu (in "Edit").

	* Option in combination with Command or Control is mapped to Meta by
	default, allowing you to enter key combinations such as C-M-\
	easily. If you'd like to map it to alt instead, just add this to
	your .emacs:

	(setq mac-option-modifier 'alt)

Configuration:

	* Color Themes: The color-themes package has been integrated in
	Aquamacs. Use the Option/Color Theme... menu command to choose a
	set of predefined colors for editing source code or writing
	texts. This applies to the current frame only, but you can make it
	the default for all new frames or for all frames in a specific
	mode with the according menu commands.

	* There is a new customization group called 'Aquamacs' that
	allows you to modify the customizations introduced by Aquamacs.
	This is fairly untested - unexpected results may occur. If so, try
	to locate and fix the bug and send us a patch. If you couldn't
	find the problem, please report via Help/Send Bug
	Report...  PLEASE NOTE that a lot of customization variables have
	changed their names - usually, you just need to prepend 1on1- to
	them.

	* Aquamacs will load YOUR configuration files not just from
	~/.emacs, but also from the location that is appropriate for a Mac
	OS X installation:

	* /Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el
	/Library/Preferences/Emacs/Preferences.el
	~/Library/Preferences/Emacs/Preferences.el

	* It is recommended to use these instead of ~/.emacs on OS X-only
	installations. The first two files should be used for the
	host-wide and user-specific Aquamacs configs, the latter two for
	general Emacs configurations.

	* There is a new configuration option that gives you more fine-grained
	control over how the option modifier key is handled.

	* If mac-pass-option-to system is nil, your Aquamacs will get all
	key combinations. If you press option-3, Aquamacs will see "M-3"
	(or, depending on mac-option-modifier "A-3"). If it is non-nil,
	you will simply get the pound sign (£) on a US keyboard.

External Tools Support:

	* TeXniScope support in LaTeX mode (if installed in /Applications).

User Documentation:

	* We have two great manuals available comfortably via Apple Help  now,
	directly from within Aquamacs Emacs (Help menu). There is a
	brand-new Aquamacs manual written by Kevin, and there is Richard
	Stallman's original Emacs manual. They can be searched (e.g. via
	Spotlight on OS X 10.4). We also provide direct access to the
	online configuration Wiki, which has been filling up with content
	nicely.  Please contribute - everybody has write access!

BUG FIXES:

	* When modified files existed, but no frame was visible and
	one tried to quit Aquamacs, the application seemed to hang while
	prompting for keyboard input (Save file? y/n) in an invisible
	window. This has been fixed.

	* If no frame is visible and you input text, the frame is  made
	visible so you can see what you are doing.

	* Closing windows consistently with the mouse now works properly. 

	* Clicking on links to source files in help buffers properly
	opens a new frame (if "open buffers in separate frames" is on).

	* When the buffer shown in a frame changes, sometimes the
	color theme and font were not set correctly; this has been
	addressed. This could happen when "Show Buffers in Separate
	Frames" was off, and one killed a buffer. (Reported by Peter
	Dyballa.)

	* When "Show Buffers in Separate Frames" was off, and one killed a
	buffer (kill-buffer, C-x k), the frame was deleted.

	* You have the option to save newly created buffers (Command-N) that
	have not been saved yet when you quit Aquamacs.

	* Less frame-dancing (resizing) on startup.

	* AUCTeX uses the standard commands again. The menu is
	unstructured for this reason. 
	(Reported by Robert Sloan.)

	* No frames could be opened when using a two-screen setup
	with the menu bar on the right screen, and a currently selected
	frame on the left screen. This has been addressed.  
	(Reported by George W. Gilchrist.)

	* Customizing a theme for a special display frame (e.g.  help or
	customization) works now.

	* Recent Files/Clear Menu works again.

	* Paths and other environment variables are now derived
	from the shell (as defined in ~/.bash_profile and elsewhere) when
	you start Aquamacs.

	* Your settings for highlight parens, "Blinking Cursor," etc.  are now
	persistent. The function Options/Save Options
	(menu-bar-option-save) now correctly saves such settings. This
	should include most customization settings except some that
	Aquamacs relies on for proper clipboard copy/paste functionality.

	* The font menu (Options) no longer includes non-existent fonts. 

	* Option/Show-Hide/Menu Bar is gone because you cannot turn off  the
	menu bar on OS X.

	* "Send Emacs Bug Report" now uses the OS X default mail program to
	compose a message. This ensures that bug reports actually go
	through.  Before, they did not, unless you were running a local
	SMTP server (sendmail/postfix), which is not enabled by default.

	* Fixed loading of files when file names contain certain  Kanji characters,
	due to a bug in AppleScript.

	* The menu shortcut entries were corrected.

	* Characters that require the use of the option key work again. For
	example, Alt-3 produces the pound sign (£) on a US keyboard, Alt-L
	the 'at' sign @ and Alt-Shift-7 the backslash \ on a German
	one. Inputting the Euro sign works, too. However, that means that
	the option key is not used to emulate the 'meta' modifier; you
	will have to use Esc to do that.  Alternatively, you can map the
	option key to meta in your .emacs file:

	(setq mac-option-modifier 'meta)

	* Improvements in the fontset selection allow you to display the
	Euro sign with the default font.

	* initial-frame-alist is respected
	(reported by Alastair Rankine)
 
	
	
DETAILED LIST OF CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.1
===========================================
 
0.9.2 beta-9	

	* "Recursive Minibuffers" are enabled. 

	* "Subscribe to mailing list" in Help menu

	* BUGFIX: initial-frame-alist is respected
	(reported by Alastair Rankine)

	* PHP-Mode included (M-x php-mode)

	* Ruby-Mode included (M-x ruby-mode)

	* yes-or-no-p is customizable now. Use the new customization
 	variable aquamacs-quick-yes-or-no-prompt.
	(Thanks: Pavel Hlavnicka)

	* Soft word wrap (longlines-mode) is available from the Options
	menu. To make it the default, add this to your preferences
	file:	
	(set-default 'longlines-mode t)

	* Case-insensitive search option has gone into "search" submenu (in "Edit").

	* if you're in an empty frame (i.e. a frame with an empty buffer)
	and you load (find) a file, Aquamcas will not open an additional frame.
	This is useful also for drag&drops, when a scratch frame is open.
	
	* BUGFIX: When saving a buffer and the Finder is not running, 
	the Finder is not opened any more. 
	(reported by George W. Gilchrist)

	* BUGFIX: using dead-keys (like Option-u or Option-n on most
	keyboards) works again.
	(reported by Howard Melman and Pierre Albarede)
 
0.9.2 beta-8
	
	* Some key-bindings are more like the original Emacs ones - in
	particular M-w, which does kill-ring-save again. 
	(Idea: Joe Davison)
	Also, Home and End keys work as expected.

	* Slightly faster startup.

	* New fonts available - Chinese & Japanese support thanks to the
	carbon-font package.
	
	* Emacs now sets the file creator information of files it
	writes. This helps to open the file from Finder with Emacs when
	you double-click it. Feature can be turned off via customization
	option "aquamacs-set-creator-codes-after-writing-files".  Also,
	Emacs will appear in the Finder's context menu under "Open With"
	for a lot of files that it is commonly used to edit.

	* Better Drag&Drop: For example, you can drag&drop a graphics
        file into your LaTeX document now from the Finder, and
        Aquamacs will insert an appropriate reference. (This is Seiji
        Zenitani's mac-drag-N-drop package.)

	* BUGFIX: Two-finger-scrolling on new Powerbooks works.
	(Thanks: Yamamoto M.)

	* BUGFIX: When modified files existed, but no frame was visible and
	one tried to quit Emacs, the application seemed to hang while
	prompting for keyboard input (Save file? y/n) in an invisible
	window.   
 	
	* BUGFIX: If no frame is visible and you input text, the frame is made
	visible so you can see what you are doing.	

	* BUGFIX: Closing windows with the mouse didn't always work

	* BUGFIX: Clicking on links to source files in help buffers properly
	opens a new frame (if "open buffers in separate frames" is on).

	* BUGFIX: When the buffer shown in a frame changes, sometimes the
	color theme and font weren't set correctly. This could happen when
	"Show Buffers in Separate Frames" was off, and one killed a
	buffer. (Reported by Peter Dyballa.)

	* BUGFIX: When "Show Buffers in Separate Frames" was off, and one killed a
	buffer (kill-buffer, C-x k), the frame was deleted.
	
	* BUGFIX: You're offered to save newly created buffers (Command-N)
	that haven't been saved yet when you quit Emacs.

	* FEATURE: Lucida Grande is now available in a range of sizes, and
	we have a Monaco 11pt now, as well. 

	* The default font for all modes is now the monospaced
	"Monaco". That means that you'll get properly formatted text in a
	lot of very specialized modes for which you haven't defined a
	mode-specific default theme. Note that for text modes (including
	tex-mode), we still have Lucida. You can override that, of course,
	with the functions in the Options menu (Set .. as default, Save
	Options).

	* BUGFIX: Less frame-dancing (resizing) on startup.
	
	* BUGFIX: AUCTeX uses the standard commands again. The menu is
	pretty unstructured for this reason. 
	(Reported by Robert Sloan.)

	* BUGFIX: No frames could be opened when using a two-screen setup
	with the menu bar on the right screen, and a currently selected
	frame on the left screen. Pretty obscure, eh?
	(Reported by George W. Gilchrist.)

	* We make sure that the *Completions* buffer (and similar things)
	open as a window inside the frame directly above the Minibuffer,
	and not in a new frame.

	* Sound signal (ding) on error, but not on non-errors and
	traditional dings. Turn off via customization function
	aquamacs-ring-bell-on-error.

	* Some left-over customizations (re Prolog, Perl, turn-on-auto-fill) removed.

0.9.2 beta-7

	* Runs on OS X 10.3.9, 10.4.0 and 10.4.1 - tested.

0.9.2 beta-6

	* 10.4.1 only

	* Should not complain about missing fonts any more when
	you've upgraded from earlier versions and set scalable fonts as
	default fonts for modes or all frames. The get filtered automatically.

	* Users with certain setups (cyrillic Lucida Grande) should not get
	a "default font not found" error any more

0.9.2 beta-5

	* 10.4.1 only

	* All newly opened frames open in a somewhat useful position, so
	they're not in the way. (If you don't like this, I suggest you set
	your own static frame positions via "set current theme as default"
	and also add this to your file ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs
	Emacs/Preferences.el:

	(setq smart-frame-positioning-enforce nil)

	* Or, if you'd like to go with the default position all the time,
	turn the global minor mode off:

	* (smart-frame-positioning-mode nil)

	* The secondary selection is back: use the Command (Apple) key
	together with clicking/dragging the mouse cursor over text in
	order to select text that is not related to the point
	(cursor). This way, you can select text and then scroll somewhere
	else. Extend your selection with shift-command-mouse1.
	To copy/cut the text in the secondary selection to the clipboard, use
	Shift-Command-C/X, respectively.

	* Aquamacs got a whole lot snappier:
	After two sleepless nights, newly opened frames don't dance around
	on the screen any more. (Thanks to Drew Adams for advice.)

	* Aquamacs automatically checks for updates and notifies the user
	if there's something new.

	* This function communicates with an internet server; it does not
	transmit any information identifying the user. If you'd like to
	know more about what is transmitted, use M-x
	aquamacs-check-version-information. 
	
	If you like to turn this check off, add this to your file
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el:

	(setq aquamacs-version-check-url nil)

	* FEATURE: The Speedbar is back. Activate in Options/ Show/Hide. 

	* BUGFIX: customizing a theme for a special display frame (e.g. help or
	customization) works now

	* The redo function is in the Edit menu now.

	* HACK: You can start Aquamacs in a terminal (by running
	/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs) with parameter -nw
	and it'll show up in the terminal rather than as Carbon
	application. Basic file editing and all traditional commands
	work. However, Aquamacs-specific keyboard commands (with the
	Command key) won't work and other functionality may be limited,
	too. This mode of use, which may break in future versions, is not
	supported by the Aquamacs team - you're on your own!

	* New buffers (File / New) open in Text Adapt Fill mode now. 
	
	* More tuning to the way Emacs opens frames for buffers and closes
	them (i.e. kills the buffers) when you press Command-W or close
	the frame with the mouse. Buffers are not killed if the option
	"Open Buffers in Separate Frames" is deselected so that the old
	school Emacs semantics are preserved in this case. 

	* When you close a frame you get asked whether you'd like to save
	the buffer. Now you won't get asked twice (really? really!)
	
	* CVS compile 2005-06-01. Please note that you may need to update
	your custom fontsets in case you have any, since the size of
	scalable fonts is set to 0 now.

	0.9.2 beta-4

	* We have two great manuals available comfortably via Apple Help now, 
	directly from within Aquamacs Emacs (Help menu). There is a
	brand-new Aquamacs manual written by Kevin, and there is Richard
	Stallman's original Emacs manual. They can be searched (e.g. via
	Spotlight on OS X 10.4).
	We also provide direct access to the online configuration Wiki, 
	which has been filling up with content nicely. 
	Please contribute - everybody has write access!
	
	*  	No more annoying system 'ding' (bell ringing) all the time. The bell is
	turned off completely, until Emacs developers eliminate the use of
	the bell on user-initiated abort actions (such as ESC ESC ESC when
	in minibuffer, of pressing 'Cancel' in the file selection dialog).

	* The tool-bar is only displayed in normal frames, but not
	in frames that show help/info buffers. (tool-bar+ and
	aquamacs-tool-bar packages). Turn such toolbars on/off in
	Options/Show/Hide menu.

	* Aquamacs can now read the environment, including the PATH variable,
	from the shell. That means that if you have set up installed
	applications to be available from the Terminal (shell) directly,
	they will also work from within Emacs. This should make installing
	and accessing software much easier. You do not need special
	settings in ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist any more.

	* Adding Emacs packages is easier now: Emacs automatically finds
	packages in subdirectories within the [~]/Library/{Preferences|Application
	Support}/{Emacs|Aquamacs Emacs}/ paths.

	* The "About Emacs" dialogue has been improved

	* BUGFIX: Recent Files/Clear Menu works again

	* .save-places and customizations.el don't show up in the recent files list
	any more.

	* auto-save-files (in ~/.emacs.d) are now saved to ~/Library/Prefs...

	* "Save Place in Files in between sessions" will not generate files in the
	user's home folder any more - instead, the files goes into
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/ where it belongs.

	* BUGFIX: remove menu item "Open Frame on Display" as it didn't work
	anyways in Carbon Emacs 

	* BUGFIX: "Show in Finder" works in OS X 10.4 now

	* BUGFIX: Paths and other environment variables are now taken over
	from the shell (as defined in ~/.bash_profile and elsewhere) when
	you start Emacs.

	* BUGFIXes: more changes to "Display Buffers in Separate Frames"
	handling. Opens frames more reliably when no frames are visible,
	and deletes frames (created for specific buffers) when their
	buffers are killed. 
	
0.9.2 beta-3

	* CONFIGURATION

	* FEATURE: Color Themes: The color-themes package has been integrated in
	Aquamacs. Use the Option/Color Theme... menu command to choose a
	set of predefined colors for editing source code or writing
	texts. This applies to the current frame only, but you can make it
	the default for all new frames or for all frames in a specific
	mode with the according menu commands. 
	
	* FEATURE: There is a new customization group called 'Aquamacs' that
	allows you to modify the customizations introduced by Aquamacs.
	This is fairly untested - unexpected results may occur. If so, try
	to locate and fix the bug and send us a patch. If you couldn't
	find the problem, please report via Help/Send Bug Report... 
	PLEASE NOTE that a lot of customization variables have changed
	their names - usually, you just need to prepend 1on1- to them.
	
	* BUGFIX: Your settings for highlight parens, "Blinking Cursor" etc. are now
	persistent. The function Options/Save Options
	(menu-bar-option-save) now correctly saves such settings. This
	should include most customization settings except some that
	Aquamacs relies on for proper clipboard copy/paste functionality.

	* FEATURE:
	Aquamacs will load YOUR configuration files not just from
	~/.emacs, but also from the location that is appropriate for a Mac
	OS X installation:

	* /Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el
	/Library/Preferences/Emacs/Preferences.el
	~/Library/Preferences/Emacs/Preferences.el

	* It is recommended to use these instead of ~/.emacs on OS X-only 
	installations. The first two files should be used for the
	host-wide and user-specific Aquamacs configs, the latter two for
	general Emacs configurations. 

	* FEATURE:
	Fringes (margins next to a window) are displayed for normal
	buffers now (but not in special buffers such as *Help* etc.)

	* BUGFIX: Changes in the way buffers are killed and windows are
	closed. You should not notice anything, except that this should be
	more compatible with additional Emacs packages.
	* BUGFIX: The font menu (Options) doesn't contain all those non-existing fonts any more
	* BUGFIX: Option/Show-Hide/Speedbar is gone because the speedbar doesn't work.
	* BUGFIX: Option/Show-Hide/Menu Bar is gone because you can't turn of the
	menu bar on OS X.
	
USABILITY:
	
	* FEATURE: Command-` now cycles between different windows (suggested by Joseph Kiniry)
	* FEATURE/BUGFIX: Send Emacs Bug Report now uses the OS X 
	default mail program to compose
	a message. This ensures that bug reports actually go through -
	before they did not, unless you were running a local SMTP server
	(sendmail/postfix) which is not enabled by default.
	* BUGFIX: Fixed loading of files when file names contain certain Kanji characters,
	due to a bug in AppleScript.  

	* MISC:

	* Some large .el files and a 700K termcap.src file deleted from the distribution.
	
0.9.2 beta-2

	* USABILITY:
	* FEATURE: 
	A further improvement. Key combinations with the option key that involve
	another modifier (that is, ctrl or command) will now work, even
	though simple option combinations are handled by the system to
	produce special characters. 

	* Option is mapped to Meta by default, allowing you to enter key
	combinations such as C-M-\ easily. If you'd like to map it to
	alt instead, just add this to your .emacs:

	(setq mac-option-modifier 'alt)
	
	* FEATURE:
	There is a new configuration option that gives you more fine-grained
	control over how the option modifier key is handled.

	* If mac-pass-option-to system is nil, your Aquamacs will get all key
	combinations. If you press option-3, Aquamacs will see "M-3" (or,
	depending on mac-option-modifier "A-3"). If it is non-nil, you
	will simply get the pound sign (£) on a US keyboard.

	* FEATURE:
	Aquamacs will load packaged configuration files residing in

	* /Library/Application Support/Aquamacs Emacs
	~/Library/Application Support/Aquamacs Emacs
	/Library/Application Support/Emacs
	~/Library/Application Support/Emacs
	
	in addition to those in the 'Emacs' directories. These function
	just like any .emacs file in ~/. 
	Use of these directories is recommended only for configurations
	installed by add-on-packages. 

	* FEATURE:
	TeXniScope support in LaTeX mode (if installed in /Applications)

	* FEATURE:
	Command-backspace deletes the whole line now. Useful e.g. 
	when you're loading a file with C-x C-f and you need to delete 
	the given path.

	* BUGFIX:
	Fails more gracefully if a font is not present: defaults are never set 
	to a non-existing font, so no error message is given. 

	* BUGFIX:
	menu shortcut entries corrected

	* 
0.9.2 beta-1

	* BUGFIX:
	characters that require the use of the option key work again - for
	example, Alt-3 produces the pound sign (£) on a US keyboard, 
	Alt-L the 'at' sign @ and Alt-Shift-7 the backslash \ on a 
	German one. Inputting the Euro sign works, too.
	However, that means that the option key is not used to emulate
	the 'meta' modifier - you will have to use Esc to do that.
	Alternatively, you can map the option key to meta in your .emacs
	file:

	(setq mac-option-modifier 'meta)

	* BUGFIX:
	Improvements in the fontset selection allow you to display the Euro sign
	with the default font.

	* FEATURE:
	Cursor is a bar now, following the general trend in most OS X
	editors. This seems to make marking text with the mouse a little
	easier and makes sense conceptually. This will be modified further
	to accomodate overwrite-mode.
	You can turn it off easily in your .emacs:

	* (set-default 'cursor-type 'box)

	* FEATURE:
	Customization settings and a list of recent files are now saved into 
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/
	
	Settings you may have kept in .emacs are still read. You should
	save the settings once (after making some change!) and then delete
	the appropriate section manually from your .emacs file.

	* Note that this only applies to the settings saved with 'Save
	Options', not your individual .emacs configuration.
	
	* FEATURE:
	the Perl mode (CPerl) it comes with is less aggressive with respect to
	'electric' keywords and parens - this was just too annoying.
	Turn it back on, for example with the cperl-hairy variable in your .emacs.

VERSION 0.9.1
===========================================

	* This version has been reported to work on OS X 10.4 "Tiger" 
	and on OS X 10.3 "Panther."
	(Thanks Nozomu Ando, Yamamoto Mitsuharu)

	* LATEX
	* AUCTeX support: install Norm Gall's AucTeX package 
	(into /Library/Application Support/Emacs), available here:
	https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132323&package_id=150263&release_id=325255
	* Elisp load-path now inludes the directories under
	/Library/Application Support/Emacs/

	* FONTS
	* Nicer font thanks to  anti-aliasing (finally) - the font now looks just
	like in other Mac applications (lucida, mac fontsets. Other
	fontsets without anti-aliasing available - just switch to fontset
	'default'.
	* The available fixed-width Monaco fontsets have been improved: there are
	nice 12 and 14-point versions available now besides the 10pt one.
	* More non-proportional default fonts for specific modes set
	(Python, Perl, C etc.)
	* Set current fontset as a default for new frames with the new function in the
	Options menu.
	* The default font is saved to .emacs with "Save Options".
	So if you don't like Lucida as normal font, just switch to another
	font in the font menu (Options/Set Font/Fontset), then do "Set
	current Fontset as default" and then "Save Options". Voilà!
	* Some additional fontsets are available now.
	The mac_roman* fontsets allow you to display
	the Euro sign. (Note that ENTERING the Euro sign is a different
	matter and depends on your input method / language environment.
	Further work in this area to do things Mac-like needs to be done.)
	* You can also set fonts specific to the mode. By default, you'll get a
	proportional font (Lucida Grande) for text modes, but the
	non-proportional font for the elisp mode.
	* You may now set a default font in your ~/.emacs file by adding

	(setq default-frame-font "fontset-monaco12")
	(set-default-frame-alist)
	
	Of course, you don't have to use one of the predefined fontsets.

	* HANDLING WINDOWS / FRAMES
	* Aquamacs is slightly more conservative when opening new frames for new
	buffers. Stuff like backtraces, completion buffers and the like
	always appear in the same window now. 
	Special modes that rely on windows inside the frames should
	work much better now.
	* Newly created frames (windows) are deleted (removed) when necessary,
	that is, when their buffer is killed - for
	example when you do C-x C-r to get a list of the recent files but
	then get rid of the display by pressing q. This should lead to
	more graceful behavior in many places.
	* New frames (windows) don't appear low on the screen any more
	* Pressing Apple-W will now kill the buffer (i.e. close the file)
	along with deleting the window (closing the window) that the point
	(cursor) was in. (Special buffers such as *Messages* or *scratch*
	are never killed!)
	* "New" entry in the menu bar now just opens a new frame&buffer
	* Aquamacs Emacs should not quit any more when you close the last frame.
	(Standard OS X behavior)

	* MISCELLANEOUS
	* Fringe and toolbar settings can be customized (Options menu) and saved
	to .emacs.
	* No toolbars any more for help windows and other special frames.
	* The most common keyboard commands (Apple-A/C/X/V/Q/F/G/N) are 
	displayed in the menus as you expect it - alongside their
	traditional Emacs equivalents
	* Copy/Paste from other applications and from within Emacs have been
	modified and should be more stable now.
	* Apple-O file dialogs don't display hidden files any more (use
	the old C-x C-f  to open special files).	
	* Apple-C (copy) doesn't remove the selection any more
	* CUA mode is on, but without C-* shortcuts (thanks: Lawrence Akka)
	[Note that Apple-C/X/V is not handled by cua-mode at this point.]
	* Mac keyboard commands can now be turned off by switching off the minor
	mode osx-key-mode
	(thanks to Seiji Zenitani for a code snippet from his mac-key-mode.el)
	Do people want an extra option in the menu for this?
	* Better frame opening/file-handling behavior.
	* Applescript-mode provided (courtesy of Sakito, Harlex Gorrell, Fujimoto
	Hisakuni, MacEmacs JP project)
	(please submit bugs to the MacEmacs JP project)
	* Apple (Command) shortcuts like Apple-C or Apple-W
	will not override any A- (Option/Alt) shortcuts any
	more. You may assign a modifier key to the option key by saying

	(setq mac-option-modifier 'meta)  ;; or 'ctrl or 'alt

	* in your .emacs file.  Similarly, you can set the variables
	mac-control-modifier. Do not use mac-command-key-is-meta or 
	mac-reverse-ctrl-meta any more - they are deprecated in Aquamacs.

	* If you need the Command to be meta, you can set the variable
	mac-command-modifier to 'meta. Obviously, you will lose the
	Command shortcuts - you can't have it all. It is recommended,
	however, to use ESC as the Meta key, which is the default.

	* Note that these variables are only available in Aquamacs at this
	point.

	* Transparency settings included, do a

	(setq mac-transparency-alpha 80)

	* and open a frame to check it out. (Thanks: T. Hiromatsu)

	* Shift-Click extends the region (selection) to where you click. (This
	also means that you won't get the font menu this way; but it
	wasn't very useful anyways, and very non-standard.)
	(Thanks: Lawrence Akka)

	* Tramp mode (in particular: calling ssh) should work - a patch that
	disabled this is no longer needed. You will need OS X >=10.3
	though to avoid a little problem with the output of external processes!
	(Thanks: Lawrence Akka)

	* Some special packages (prolog mode) do not come with Aquamacs any more.

	* Whether you want to open new buffers in extra frames can be customized
	now. There is an option in the Options menu that can be saved
	with the "Save Options" function.

	* Various text input method improvements

	* (based on emacs 22.0.50.1 CVS May-2005 plus patches)

	* Thanks to all of the mentioned people and to 
	Stefan Monnier, Steven Tamm, Drew Adams for their helpful hints.
