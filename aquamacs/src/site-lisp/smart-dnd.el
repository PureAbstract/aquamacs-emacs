;;; Commentary

;; This package provides user-configurable drag-n-drop feature to Emacs 22.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; First, evaluate `smart-dnd-setup' function in the buffer
;; by using the following alist argument.
;; The code modifies drag-n-drop behaviour in the local buffer and then
;; a string "image file: file.png" will be inserted when *.png file is dropped.
;;
;; (require 'smart-dnd)
;; (smart-dnd-setup
;;  '(
;;    ("\\.png\\'" . "image file: %f\n")
;;    ("\\.jpg\\'" . "image file: %f\n")
;;    (".exe\\'"   . (message (concat "executable: " f)))
;;    (".*"        . "any filename: %f\n")
;;    ))
;;
;; String elements will be formatted by `smart-dnd-string'.
;; You can also put elisp expression into the alist.
;; A local variable 'f' will be replaced by the dropped filename.
;;
;; Major-mode-hook would be good place to install your own configuration.
;; For example,
;;
;; html-mode:
;;
;; (add-hook
;;  'html-mode-hook
;;  (lambda ()
;;    (smart-dnd-setup
;;     '(
;;       ("\\.gif\\'" . "<img src=\"%r\">\n")
;;       ("\\.jpg\\'" . "<img src=\"%r\">\n")
;;       ("\\.png\\'" . "<img src=\"%r\">\n")
;;       ("\\.css\\'" . "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"%r\">\n" )
;;       ("\\.js\\'"  . "<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"%r\"></script>\n" )
;;       (".*" . "<a href=\"%r\">%f</a>\n")
;;       ))))
;;
;; LaTeX mode:
;;
;; (add-hook
;;  'latex-mode-hook
;;  (lambda ()
;;    (smart-dnd-setup
;;     '(
;;       ("\\.tex\\'" . "\\input{%r}\n")
;;       ("\\.cls\\'" . "\\documentclass{%f}\n")
;;       ("\\.sty\\'" . "\\usepackage{%f}\n")
;;       ("\\.eps\\'" . "\\includegraphics[]{%r}\n")
;;       ("\\.ps\\'"  . "\\includegraphics[]{%r}\n")
;;       ("\\.pdf\\'" . "\\includegraphics[]{%r}\n")
;;       ("\\.jpg\\'" . "\\includegraphics[]{%r}\n")
;;       ("\\.png\\'" . "\\includegraphics[]{%r}\n")
;;       ))))
;;
;; C/C++ mode:
;; 
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
;;           (lambda () (smart-dnd-setup '(("\\.h\\'" . "#include <%f>")))))
