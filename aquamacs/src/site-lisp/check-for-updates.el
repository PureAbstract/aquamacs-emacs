        Aquamacs - Version update check
 
        Aquamacs automatically checks for updates and notifies the user
	if there's something new. 
	Your privacy:  While checking for a new version, Aquamacs
	contacts an internet server to get the version number - this
	happens once every 3 days. The server will receive and 
	store the following anonymous connection data: 
	an anonymous ID, the number of program starts and the 
	version of Aquamacs that you're using. Like every web server, 
	your IP address and the time of your inquiry may be stored,
	too. This information is used to produce statistics; we delete the
	original data after a period of time. The statistics solely
	inform the Aquamacs development. 

	If you like to turn this check off, add this to your file
	~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el:

	(setq aquamacs-version-check-url nil)
