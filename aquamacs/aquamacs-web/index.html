By"Aqua-native," we mean more than just the fact that this version ofEmacs runs as a standard OS X application.&nbsp; Aquamacs featuresextensive customization that enables it to conform better with Apple'sstandard Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) than standard versions of theeditor do.</p>  <p> <a href="aquamacs-screenshot.png"><img src="aquamacs-screenshot.png" width="272" height="201" border="1"></a></p><p>Emacs is a text editor oflegendary power and configurability, but it also has an enormouslycomplex interface that, while consistent across platforms, is usuallyat odds with the specific interface conventions of the particularplatform on which it is being used. The official OS X version of Emacs,called Carbon Emacs, is no different. <br></p><p>For instance, the standardEmacs keyboard shortcut to open a file is C-x C-f, accompanied by atext message in the status bar at the bottom of the main window thatrequests the directory and name of the file. By contrast, the standardAqua keyboard shortcut is Apple-O (Command-O), followed by a Finderdialog box that asks the user to navigate to the appropriate directoryand file.</p><p>The Aquamacs distributionimplements the standard OS X keyboard shortcuts and other interfaceconventions, integrating Emacs into the Aqua environment to a fargreater degree than other versions of Emacs. This allows Mac&nbsp;users who might be unfamiliar with Emacs' complex standard interface toharness its amazing editing power in a familiar way. </p><p>The Aquamacs distributionaccomplishes its Aqua integration by making use of a number ofopen-source customization scripts that have been written by variousdevelopers, and packaged/documented by David Reitter and Kevin Walzer.</p><p>To install the Aquamacsdistribution of Emacs, just drag the application to your /Applicationsdirectory. Everything necessary to run the program is contained in theapplication itself. </p></div><A href="http://sourceforge.net"> <IMG src="http://sourceforge.net/ sflogo.php?group_id=138078&amp;type=5" width="210" height="62"  border="0" alt="SourceForge.net Logo" /></A></body></html>
