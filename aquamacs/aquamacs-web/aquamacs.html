<h1>Emacs: the Aquamacs
Distribution</h1>
<p>Aquamacs is an Aqua-native
build of the powerful <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">
Emacs </a> text editor. By
"Aqua-native," we mean more than just the fact that this version of
Emacs runs as a standard OS X application.&nbsp; Aquamacs features
extensive customization that enables it to conform better with Apple's
standard Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) than standard versions of the
editor do.</p>
<p>Emacs is a text editor of
legendary power and configurability, but it also has an enormously
complex interface that, while consistent across platforms, is usually
at odds with the specific interface conventions of the particular
platform on which it is being used. The official OS X version of Emacs,
called Carbon Emacs, is no different. <br>
</p>
<p>For instance, the standard
Emacs keyboard shortcut to open a file is C-x C-f, accompanied by a
text message in the status bar at the bottom of the main window that
requests the directory and name of the file. By contrast, the standard
Aqua keyboard shortcut is Apple-O (Command-O), followed by a Finder
dialog box that asks the user to navigate to the appropriate directory
and file.</p>
<p>The Aquamacs distribution
implements the standard OS X keyboard shortcuts and other interface
conventions, integrating Emacs into the Aqua environment to a far
greater degree than other versions of Emacs. This allows Mac&nbsp;
users who might be unfamiliar with Emacs' complex standard interface to
harness its amazing editing power in a familiar way. <br>
</p>
<p><img src="aquamacs-screenshot.png" border="1" height="431"
 width="580"></p>
<br>
<p>The Aquamacs distribution
accomplishes its Aqua integration by making use of a number of
open-source customization scripts that have been written by various
developers, and packaged/documented by David Reitter and Kevin Walzer.</p>
<p>To install the Aquamacs
distribution of Emacs, just drag the application to your /Applications
directory. Everything necessary to run the program is contained in the
application itself. </p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p><br>
Here are some of the key Aqua-specific features of the Aquamacs version
of Emacs: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Mac-standard font (Lucida
Grande) is the default for editing text.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Emacs has a standard Mac
menu, and recently used files are available from the File menu.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>You can switch between the
windows with the "Buffers"&nbsp; menu.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Clipboard operations
interoperate with other Mac apps. In the&nbsp; Aquamacs version of
Emacs, if you mark a chunk of text, it will NOT be automatically copied
into the clipboard. Just like in any Mac&nbsp; program, you can
copy with the Apple-C command, and then replace&nbsp; another
region by selecting it and hitting Apple-V (Paste).</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>The mouse wheel works as
expected.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aquamacs Emacs opens a
normal OS X window for each file that is opened - Emacs experts would
call the windows<em> frames</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Emacs remains extensible,
so you can use special syntax coloring setups or enjoy embedded CVS
support, a HTML markup menu and the like.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Join Us</h1>
<p>We should point out that
development of the Aquamacs distribution is ongoing; the UI is far from
complete. In particular, such items as configuration systems, sliders
and the mini-windows inside the windows will need further work. We
welcome contributions from the community, whether they are elisp code
that improves OS X UI compatibility, or patches to the mac-specific C
code, which would be too early to submit for inclusion in the main
Emacs development branch. </p>
<p><em>Developers</em>
should contact <a href="http://www.reitter-it-media.de/mailme.html">David
Reitter</a> with questions,
comments, and contributions. </p>

</ul>
<div>
<p><strong>Fonts</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Nicer font thanks to
anti-aliasing (finally) - the font now looks just like in other Mac
applications (lucida, mac fontsets. Other fontsets without
anti-aliasing available - just switch to fontset 'default'.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p> The available fixed-width
Monaco fontsets have been improved: there are nice 12 and 14-point
versions available now besides the 10pt one.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>More non-proportional
default fonts for specific modes set (Python, Perl, C etc.)</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Set current fontset as a
default for new frames with the new function in the Options menu.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>The default font is saved
to .emacs with "Save Options". So if you don't like Lucida as normal
font, just switch to another font in the font menu (Options/Set
Font/Fontset), then do "Set current Fontset as default" and then "Save
Options". </p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Some additional fontsets
are available now. The mac_roman* fontsets allow you to display the
Euro sign. (Note that ENTERING the Euro sign is a different matter and
depends on your input method / language environment. Further work in
this area to do things Mac-like needs to be done.) - You can also set
fonts specific to the mode. By default, you'll get a proportional font
(Lucida Grande) for text modes, but the non-proportional font for the
elisp mode</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>You may now set a default
font in your ~/.emacs file by adding (setq default-frame-font
"fontset-monaco12") (set-default-frame-alist) Of course, you don't have
to use one of the predefined fontsets.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><strong>Handling
Windows/Frames</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Aquamacs is slightly more
conservative when opening new frames for new buffers. Stuff like
backtraces, completion buffers and the like always appear in the same
window now. Special modes that rely on windows inside the frames should
work much better now.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p> Newly created frames
(windows) are deleted (removed) when necessary, that is, when their
buffer is killed - for example when you do C-x C-r to get a list of the
recent files but then get rid of the display by pressing q. This should
lead to more graceful behavior in many places.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>New frames (windows) don't
appear low on the screen any more</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Pressing Apple-W will now
kill the buffer (i.e. close the file) along with deleting the window
(closing the window) that the point (cursor) was in. (Special buffers
such as *Messages* or *scratch* are never killed!)</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>"New" entry in the menu bar
now just opens a new frame&amp;buffer</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Aquamacs Emacs should not
quit any more when you close the last frame. (Standard OS X behavior)<br>
    </p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Fringe and toolbar settings
can be customized (Options menu) and saved to .emacs.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>No toolbars any more for
help windows and other special frames.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>The most common keyboard
commands (Apple-A/C/X/V/Q/F/G/N) are displayed in the menus as you
expect it - alongside their traditional Emacs equivalents</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p> Copy/Paste from other
applications and from within Emacs have been modified and should be
more stable now.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Apple-O file dialogs don't
display hidden files any more (use the old C-x C-f to open special
files). </p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p> Apple-C (copy) doesn't
remove the selection any more</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>CUA mode is on, but without
C-* shortcuts (thanks: Lawrence Akka) [Note that Apple-C/X/V is not
handled by cua-mode at this point.]</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Mac keyboard commands can
now be turned off by switching off the minor mode osx-key-mode<br>
(thanks to Seiji Zenitani for a code snippet from his mac-key-mode.el)
Do people want an extra option in the menu for this?</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Better frame
opening/file-handling behavior</p>
    </div>

  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Applescript-mode provided
(courtesy of Sakito, Harlex Gorrell, Fujimoto Hisakuni, MacEmacs JP
project) (please submit bugs to the MacEmacs JP project)</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Apple (Command) shortcuts
like Apple-C or Apple-W will not override any A- (Option/Alt) shortcuts
any more. You may assign a modifier key to the option key by saying
(setq mac-option-modifier 'meta) ;; or 'ctrl or 'alt in your .emacs
file. Similarly, you can set the variables mac-control-modifier. Do not
use mac-command-key-is-meta or mac-reverse-ctrl-meta any more - they
are deprecated in Aquamacs. If you need the Command to be meta, you can
set the variable mac-command-modifier to 'meta. Obviously, you will
lose the Command shortcuts - you can't have it all. It is recommended,
however, to use ESC as the Meta key, which is the default. Note that
these variables are only available in Aquamacs at this point.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Transparency settings
included, do a (setq mac-transparency-alpha 80) and open a frame to
check it out. (Thanks: T. Hiromatsu)</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p> Shift-Click extends the
region (selection) to where you click. (This also means that you won't
get the font menu this way; but it wasn't very useful anyways, and very
non-standard.) (Thanks: Lawrence Akka)</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Tramp mode (in particular:
calling ssh) should work - a patch that disabled this is no longer
needed. You will need OS X &gt;=10.3 though to avoid a little
problem with the output of external processes! (Thanks: Lawrence Akka)</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Some special packages
(prolog mode) do not come with Aquamacs any more.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p> Whether you want to open
new buffers in extra frames can be customizednow. There is an option in
the Options menu that can be saved with the "Save Options" function.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div>
    <p>Various text input method
improvements</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
