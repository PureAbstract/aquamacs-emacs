(Reported by Alastair Rankine)         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>When saving a buffer and the Finder is not running, the Finder is not         opened any more. (Reported by George W. Gilchrist.)         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Using dead-keys (like Option-u or Option-n on most keyboards) works         again. (Reported by Howard Melman and Pierre Albarede </li>      <li>When modified files existed, but no frame was visible and one tried         to quit Aquamacs, the application seemed to hang while prompting for keyboard         input (Save file? y/n) in an invisible window. This has been fixed.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>If no frame is visible and you input text, the frame is made visible         so you can see what you are doing.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Closing windows consistently with the mouse now works properly.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Clicking on links to source files in help buffers properly opens a new         frame (if "open buffers in separate frames" is on).         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>When the buffer shown in a frame changes, sometimes the color theme         and font were not set correctly; this has been addressed. This could happen         when ``Show Buffers in Separate Frames'' was off, and one killed a buffer.         (Reported by Peter Dyballa.)         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>When ``Show Buffers in Separate Frames'' was off, and one killed a buffer         (kill-buffer, C-x k), the frame was deleted.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>You have the option to save newly created buffers (Command-N) that have         not been saved yet when you quit Aquamacs.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Less frame-dancing (resizing) on startup.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>AUC<span class="logo-TeX">T<small>E</small>X</span> uses the standard         commands again. The menu is unstructured for this reason. (Reported by         Robert Sloan.)         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>No frames could be opened when using a two-screen setup with the menu         bar on the right screen, and a currently selected frame on the left screen.         This has been addressed. (Reported by George W. Gilchrist.)         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Customizing a theme for a special display frame (e.g. help or customization)         works now.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Recent Files/Clear Menu works again.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Paths and other environment variables are now derived from the shell         when you start Aquamacs.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Your settings for highlight parens,``Blinking Cursor," etc. are now         persistent. The function Options/Save Options (menu-bar-option-save) now         correctly saves such settings. This should include most customization         settings except some that Aquamacs relies on for proper clipboard copy/paste         functionality.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>The font menu (Options) no longer includes non-existent fonts.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Option/Show-Hide/Menu Bar is gone because you cannot turn off the menu         bar on OS X.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>``Send Emacs Bug Report'' now uses the OS X default mail program to         compose a message. This ensures that bug reports actually go through.         Before, they did not, unless you were running a local SMTP server (sendmail/postfix),         which is not enabled by default.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Fixed loading of files when file names contain certain Kanji characters,         due to a bug in AppleScript.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>The menu shortcut entries were corrected.         <p> </p>      </li>      <li>Characters that require the use of the option key work again. For example,         Alt-3 produces the pound sign (å£) on a US keyboard, Alt-L the `at' sign         @ and Alt-Shift-7 the backslash on a German one. Inputting the Euro sign         works, too. However, that means that the option key is not used to emulate         the `meta' modifier; you will have to use Esc to do that. Alternatively,         you can map the option key to meta in your .emacs file:         <p> <tt> (setq mac-option-modifier 'meta)</tt> </p>      </li>    </ul>    <h2>Features and Changes</h2>    <p><strong>New Address</strong></p>    <ul>      <li>We have moved Aquamacs to <tt><a name="tex2html4"  href="http://www.aquamacs.org">http://www.aquamacs.org</a></tt>. </li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>The Aquamacs wiki is now at <tt><a name="tex2html5"  href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/AquamacsEmacs/">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/AquamacsEmacs/</a></tt>.       </li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>The Aquamacs bug reporting address is now <tt><a name="tex2html6"  href="mailto:aquamacs-bugs@aquamacs.org">mailto:aquamacs-bugs@aquamacs.org</a></tt>.         This can be accessed from directly within the Aquamacs Help menu. </li>    </ul>    <blockquote>       <p>The general Aquamacs mailing list is still <tt><a name="tex2html7"  href="mailto:macosx-emacs@email.esm.psu.edu">mailto:macosx-emacs@email.esm.psu.edu</a></tt>;         e-mail <tt><a name="tex2html"  href="mailto:macosx-emacs-on@email.esm.psu.edu">mailto:macosx-emacs-on@email.esm.psu.edu</a></tt>         to subscribe. </p>    </blockquote>    <ul>      <blockquote>         <p>&nbsp;</p>      </blockquote>    </ul>    <h3>Running Aquamacs</h3>    <ul>      <li>Slightly faster startup.</li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>Runs on OS X 10.3.9, 10.4.0 and 10.4.--tested.</li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>Aquamacs automatically checks for updates and notifies the user if there         is something new.

This         helps to open the file from Finder with Aquamacs when you double-click         it. Feature can be turned off via customization option ``aquamacs-set-creator-codes-after-writing-files.''         Also, Emacs will appear in the Finder's context menu under ``Open With''         for a lot of files that it is commonly used to edit. </li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>You can start Aquamacs in a terminal (by running /Applications/ Emacs.app         /Contents/ MacOS/ Emacs) with parameter -nw and will show up in the terminal         rather than as a Carbon application. Basic file editing and all traditional         commands work. However, Aquamacs-specific keyboard commands (with the         Command key) will not work and other functionality may be limited, too.         <span  class="textit">Warning: </span>This mode of use, which may break         in future versions, is not supported by the Aquamacs team. </li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>Improvements in the fontset selection allow you to display the Euro         sign with the default font. </li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Frame and Window Operations</strong></p>    <ul>      <li> We make sure that the *Completions* buffer (and similar things) open         as a window inside the frame directly above the Minibuffer, and not in         a new frame. </li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>All newly opened frames open in a somewhat useful position, so they         are not in the way.

This         is useful also for drag and drops, when a scratch frame is open.         <p> </li>      <li>The secondary selection is back: use the Command (Apple) key together         with clicking/dragging the mouse cursor over text in order to select text         that is not related to the point (cursor). This way, you can select text         and then scroll somewhere else. Extend your selection with shift-command-mouse1.         To copy/cut the text in the secondary selection to the clipboard, use         Shift-Command-C/X, respectively.         <p> </li>      <li>Some key-bindings are more like the original Emacs ones-in particular         M-w, which does kill-ring-save again. (Idea: Joe Davison) Also, Home and         End keys work as expected.         <p> </li>      <li>No more annoying system ``ding'' (bell ringing) all the time. The bell         is turned off completely, until Emacs developers eliminate the use of         the bell on user-initiated abort actions (such as ESC ESC ESC when in         minibuffer, of pressing Cancel in the file selection dialog).         <p> </li>      <li>The toolbar is only displayed in normal frames, but not in frames that         show help/info buffers. (tool-bar+ and aquamacs-tool-bar packages). Turn         such toolbars on/off in Options/Show/Hide menu.         <p> </li>      <li>The ``About Emacs'' dialogue has been improved.         <p> </li>      <li>Key combinations with the option key that involve another modifier (that         is, ctrl or command) will now work, even though simple option combinations         are handled by the system to produce special characters.         <p> </li>      <li>The Speedbar is back. Activate in Options/ Show/Hide.         <p> </li>      <li>The redo function is in the Edit menu now.         <p> </li>      <li>New buffers (File / New) open in Text Adapt Fill mode now.         <p> </li>      <li>.save-places and customizations.el do not show up in the recent files         list any more.         <p> </li>      <li>auto-save-files (in / Users / yourname /.emacs.d) are now saved to /         Users / yourname/Library/Preferences.         <p> </li>      <li>``Save Place in Files in between sessions'' will not generate files         in the user's home folder any more. Instead, the file goes into / Users         / yourname/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/ where it belongs.         <p> </li>      <li>Command-' now cycles between different windows (suggested by Joseph         Kiniry.)         <p> </li>      <li>Option is mapped to Meta by default, allowing you to enter key combinations         such as C-M- easily. If you'd like to map it to alt instead, just add         this to your .emacs:         <p> <tt>(setq mac-option-modifier 'alt)</tt>         <p> </li>    </ul>    <p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>    <ul>      <li>Color Themes: The color-themes package has been integrated in Aquamacs.         Use the Option/Color Theme... menu command to choose a set of predefined         colors for editing source code or writing texts. This applies to the current         frame only, but you can make it the default for all new frames or for         all frames in a specific mode with the according menu commands.         <p> </li>      <li>There is a new customization group called ``Aquamacs'' that allows you         to modify the customizations introduced by Aquamacs. This is fairly untested         - unexpected results may occur. If so, try to locate and fix the bug and         send us a patch. If you couldn't find the problem, please report via Help/Send         Bug Report... PLEASE NOTE that a lot of customization variables have changed         their names--usually, you just need to prepend 1on1 to them.         <p> </li>      <li>Aquamacs will load YOUR configuration files not just from / Users /         yourname/.emacs, but also from the location that is appropriate for a         Mac OS X installation:         <p> / Library/ Preferences /Aquamacs Emacs / Preferences.el <br>          / Users / yourname/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el           <br>          /Library/Preferences / Emacs / Preferences.el <br>          / Users / yourname / Library/Preferences/Emacs/Preferences.el         <p> It is recommended to use these instead of / Users / yourname/.emacs           on OS X-only installations. The first two files should be used for the           host-wide and user-specific Aquamacs configs, the latter two for general           Emacs configurations.         <p> </li>      <li>There is a new configuration option that gives you more fine-grained         control over how the option modifier key is handled.         <p> </li>      <li>If mac-pass-option-to system is nil, your Aquamacs will get all key         combinations. If you press option-3, Aquamacs will see ``M-3'' (or, depending         on mac-option-modifier ``A-3''). If it is non-nil, you will simply get         the pound sign (å£) on a US keyboard.</li>    </ul>    <p>     <p><strong>External Tools Supports</strong></p>    <ul>      <li>TeXniScope support in LaTeX mode (if installed in /Applications).</li>    </ul>    <p><strong>User Documentation</strong></p>    <ul>      <li>We have two great manuals available comfortably via Apple Help now,         directly from within Aquamacs Emacs (Help menu). There is a brand-new         Aquamacs manual, and there is Richard Stallman's original Emacs manual.         They can be searched (e.g. via Spotlight on OS X 10.4). We also provide         direct access to the online configuration Wiki, which has been filling         up with content nicely.
