BUILDING AQUAMACS


To build Aquamacs, ensure you have

- Apple's free Developer Tools


- from the Aquamacs tar ball or obtained separately:
  - the GNU Emacs 22.1 (or later) source code in  Aquamacs/emacs.raw
  - the Aquamacs source code in Aquamacs/aquamacs
  - the build.sh script


 then, just do

cd Aquamacs
./build.sh

which will result in a compiled and packaged Aquamacs in builds/
