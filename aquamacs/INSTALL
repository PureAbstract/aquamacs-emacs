BUILDING AQUAMACS


To build Aquamacs, ensure you have

- Apple's free Developer Tools (for make, gcc, etc.)

- The Aquamacs git repository (or a source code snapshot)

Then, change to the source directory and just do

./build-aquamacs

which will result in an Aquamacs in nextstep/Aquamacs.app


The manual version: "make install", which will compile incrementally.  Alternatively, to build Emacs and just copy the new Emacs binary into the .app bundle, you may use "make".

That's it!
