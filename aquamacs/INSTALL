BUILDING AQUAMACS


To build Aquamacs (Carbon / 22), ensure you have

- Apple's free Developer Tools
- the Aquamacs GIT repository (you have probably managed to do that).

Also, you have probably already checked out the Aquamacs22 branch:

git checkout Aquamacs22


then, just do

./build-aquamacs.sh

which will result in a compiled and packaged Aquamacs in builds/


Note that when switching between git branches (e.g. from master), you may need to do a 

make maintainer-clean

in order to the get compile process to work.

Questions?
