BUILDING AQUAMACS

Aquamacs differs from standard Carbon Emacs (CVS) in the following
points:

1. C core: Several mac-specific patches are applied to the C core
   before building. At this point, these are

   - mac-transparency-path
   - mac-modifier-key-patch 

   These need to be applied before compiling.


2. Elisp extensions
   These go in the site-lisp directory of the app-bundle.

3. Additional files
   - an image in etc/, 
   - emacs manual & aquamacs manual
   - new Info.plist

4. Build
   We only distribute a self-contained build.
   At this point, official Aquamacs releases have to be built on 10.3.9
   to ensure compatibility!

5. Installer
   There can be no .pkg installer: we distribute a DMG.


There is no complete automated build process at this time. However,
you can use the script make-aquamacs (instead of make-package) to
compile a self-contained build without making a package.

Scripts to do the rest will be distributed later on, once they are
sufficiently complete!


PLEASE: DO NOT PUBLISH BINARIES OF AQUAMACS. Building is is intricate
at this point, and you may miss out on files / features /
compatibility.
