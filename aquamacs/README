BUILDING AQUAMACS

Aquamacs differs from standard Carbon Emacs (CVS) in the following
points:

1. C core: Several mac-specific patches are applied to the C core
   before building. These patches are in the 'patches' directory.

2. Elisp extensions
   These go in the site-lisp directory of the app-bundle.

3. Additional files
   - an image in etc/, 
   - emacs manual & aquamacs manual
   - new Info.plist

4. Build
   We only distribute a self-contained build.
   At this point, official Aquamacs releases have to be built on 10.3.9
   to ensure compatibility!

5. Installer
   There is no .pkg installer: for good reasons, we distribute a DMG.




BUILDING

A) 
COMPILING

There is no completely automated build process at this time. However,
you can use the script make-aquamacs (instead of make-package) to
compile a self-contained build without making a .pkg package.

Copy build/make-aquamacs into the mac/ directory of a CVS checkout of 
GNU Emacs. Important arguments are:

-no-conf    (do not run configure script again)

This creates an .app bundle which sits in mac/Aquamacs.Raw/Emacs.app

BUILDING MANUALS

Compiled manuals reside in doc directory. The scripts in 'convert' help
build the Emacs Manual. Better documentation to come.




B) INTEGRATION / INSTALLATION

The script build/install-aquamacs combines files from the build (step A)
with files from the Aquamacs CVS, in particular manuals, graphics, Info.plist
and elisp files from src/. Elisp files are compiled.
You will need to supply arguments with the correct paths - sensible
defaults are assumed (~/Projects/Aquamacs/aquamacs, ~/Projects/emacs and 
/Applications/Emacs.app as target) if no arguments are given. See the script
for details about arguments. 

QUICK-INSTALL

If you did not make a new build, you can just run build/copy-to-app to avoid
copying the whole build over.  
You will need to supply arguments with the correct paths - sensible
defaults are assumed (~/Projects/Aquamacs/aquamacs and 
/Applications/Emacs.app as target) if no arguments are given. See the script
for details about arguments. 



Scripts to do the rest will be distributed later on, once they are
sufficiently complete!


FINAL NOTE

PLEASE: DO NOT PUBLISH BINARIES OF AQUAMACS. Building is is intricate
at this point, and you may miss out on files / features /
compatibility.
