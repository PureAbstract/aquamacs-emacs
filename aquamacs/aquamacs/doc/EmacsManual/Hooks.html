<h3 class="subsection">Hooks</h4>

<p><dfn>Hooks</dfn> are an important mechanism for customization of Emacs.  A
hook is a Lisp variable which holds a list of functions, to be called on
some well-defined occasion.  (This is called <dfn>running the hook</dfn>.) 
The individual functions in the list are called the <dfn>hook functions</dfn>
of the hook.  With rare exceptions, hooks in Emacs are empty when Emacs
starts up, so the only hook functions in any given hook are the ones you
explicitly put there as customization.

   <p>Most major modes run one or more <dfn>mode hooks</dfn> as the last step of
initialization.  This makes it easy for you to customize the behavior of
the mode, by setting up a hook function to override the local variable
assignments already made by the mode.  But hooks are also used in other
contexts.  For example, the hook <code>suspend-hook</code> runs just before
Emacs suspends itself (see <a href="Exiting.html#Exiting">Exiting</a>).

   <p>Most Emacs hooks are <dfn>normal hooks</dfn>.  This means that running the
hook operates by calling all the hook functions, unconditionally, with
no arguments.  We have made an effort to keep most hooks normal so that
you can use them in a uniform way.  Every variable in Emacs whose name
ends in <code>-hook</code> is a normal hook.

   <p>There are also a few <dfn>abnormal hooks</dfn>.  These variables' names end
in <code>-hooks</code> or <code>-functions</code>, instead of <code>-hook</code>.  What
makes these hooks abnormal is that there is something peculiar about the
way its functions are called--perhaps they are given arguments, or
perhaps the values they return are used in some way.  For example,
<code>find-file-not-found-hooks</code> (see <a href="Visiting.html#Visiting">Visiting</a>) is abnormal because
as soon as one hook function returns a non-<code>nil</code> value, the rest
are not called at all.  The documentation of each abnormal hook variable
explains in detail what is peculiar about it.

   <p>The recommended way to add a hook function to a hook (either normal or
abnormal) is by calling <code>add-hook</code>.  You can use any valid Lisp
function as the hook function, provided it can handle the proper number
of arguments (zero arguments, in the case of a normal hook).  Of course,
not every Lisp function is <em>useful</em> in any particular hook.

   <p>For example, here's how to set up a hook to turn on Auto Fill mode
when entering Text mode and other modes based on Text mode:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
     </pre>

   <p>The next example shows how to use a hook to customize the indentation
of C code.  (People often have strong personal preferences for one
format compared to another.)  Here the hook function is an anonymous
lambda expression.

<pre class="example">     (setq my-c-style
       '((c-comment-only-line-offset . 4)
         (c-cleanup-list . (scope-operator
     		       empty-defun-braces
     		       defun-close-semi))
         (c-offsets-alist . ((arglist-close . c-lineup-arglist)
     			(substatement-open . 0)))))
     
     (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
       '(lambda ()
          (c-add-style "my-style" my-c-style t)))
     </pre>

   <p>It is best to design your hook functions so that the order in which
they are executed does not matter.  Any dependence on the order is
"asking for trouble."  However, the order is predictable: the most
recently added hook functions are executed first.
