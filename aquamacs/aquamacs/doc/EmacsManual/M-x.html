<h2 class="chapter">Running Commands by Name</h2>

<p>Every Emacs command has a name that you can use to run it.  Commands
that are used often, or that must be quick to type, are also bound to
keys--short sequences of characters--for convenient use.  You can
run them by name if you don't remember the keys.  Other Emacs commands
that do not need to be quick are not bound to keys; the only way to
run them is by name.  See <a href="Key-Bindings.html#Key%20Bindings">Key Bindings</a>, for the description of
how to bind commands to keys.

   <p>By convention, a command name consists of one or more words,
separated by hyphens; for example, <code>auto-fill-mode</code> or
<code>manual-entry</code>.  The use of English words makes the command name
easier to remember than a key made up of obscure characters, even
though it is more characters to type.

   <p>The way to run a command by name is to start with <kbd>M-x</kbd>, type the
command name, and finish it with &lt;RET&gt;.  <kbd>M-x</kbd> uses the
minibuffer to read the command name.  &lt;RET&gt; exits the minibuffer and
runs the command.  The string <code>M-x</code> appears at the beginning of the
minibuffer as a <dfn>prompt</dfn> to remind you to enter the name of a
command to be run.  See <a href="Minibuffer.html#Minibuffer">Minibuffer</a>, for full information on the
features of the minibuffer.

   <p>You can use completion to enter the command name.  For example, you
can invoke the command <code>forward-char</code> by name by typing either

<pre class="example">     M-x forward-char &lt;RET&gt;
     </pre>

<p>or

<pre class="example">     M-x forw &lt;TAB&gt; c &lt;RET&gt;
     </pre>

<p>Note that <code>forward-char</code> is the same command that you invoke with
the key <kbd>C-f</kbd>.  You can run any Emacs command by name using
<kbd>M-x</kbd>, whether or not any keys are bound to it.

   <p>If you type <kbd>C-g</kbd> while the command name is being read, you cancel
the <kbd>M-x</kbd> command and get out of the minibuffer, ending up at top level.

   <p>To pass a numeric argument to the command you are invoking with
<kbd>M-x</kbd>, specify the numeric argument before the <kbd>M-x</kbd>.  <kbd>M-x</kbd>
passes the argument along to the command it runs.  The argument value
appears in the prompt while the command name is being read.

   <p>If the command you type has a key binding of its own, Emacs mentions
this in the echo area, two seconds after the command finishes (if you
don't type anything else first).  For example, if you type <kbd>M-x
forward-word</kbd>, the message says that you can run the same command more
easily by typing <kbd>M-f</kbd>.  You can turn off these messages by setting
<code>suggest-key-bindings</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>Normally, when describing in this manual a command that is run by
name, we omit the &lt;RET&gt; that is needed to terminate the name.  Thus
we might speak of <kbd>M-x auto-fill-mode</kbd> rather than <kbd>M-x
auto-fill-mode &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  We mention the &lt;RET&gt; only when there is
a need to emphasize its presence, such as when we show the command
together with following arguments.

   <p><kbd>M-x</kbd> works by running the command
<code>execute-extended-command</code>, which is responsible for reading the
name of another command and invoking it.
