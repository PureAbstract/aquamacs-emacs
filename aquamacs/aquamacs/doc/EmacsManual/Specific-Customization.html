<h3 class="subsubsection">Customizing Specific Items</h5>

<p>Instead of finding the options you want to change by moving down
through the structure of groups, you can specify the particular option,
face or group that you want to customize.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-x customize-option &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>option</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Set up a customization buffer with just one option, <var>option</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-face &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>face</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Set up a customization buffer with just one face, <var>face</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-group &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>group</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Set up a customization buffer with just one group, <var>group</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-apropos &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>regexp</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Set up a customization buffer with all the options, faces and groups
that match <var>regexp</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-changed-options &lt;RET&gt; </kbd><var>version</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Set up a customization buffer with all the options, faces and groups
whose meaning has changed since Emacs version <var>version</var>. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-saved</kbd>
     <dd>Set up a customization buffer containing all options and faces that you
have saved with customization buffers. 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x customize-customized</kbd>
     <dd>Set up a customization buffer containing all options and faces that you
have customized but not saved. 
</dl>

   <p>If you want to alter a particular user option variable with the
customization buffer, and you know its name, you can use the command
<kbd>M-x customize-option</kbd> and specify the option name.  This sets up
the customization buffer with just one option--the one that you asked
for.  Editing, setting and saving the value work as described above, but
only for the specified option.

   <p>Likewise, you can modify a specific face, chosen by name, using
<kbd>M-x customize-face</kbd>.

   <p>You can also set up the customization buffer with a specific group,
using <kbd>M-x customize-group</kbd>.  The immediate contents of the chosen
group, including option variables, faces, and other groups, all appear
as well.  However, these subgroups' own contents start out hidden.  You
can show their contents in the usual way, by invoking <code>[Show]</code>.

   <p>To control more precisely what to customize, you can use <kbd>M-x
customize-apropos</kbd>.  You specify a regular expression as argument; then
all options, faces and groups whose names match this regular expression
are set up in the customization buffer.  If you specify an empty regular
expression, this includes <em>all</em> groups, options and faces in the
customization buffer (but that takes a long time).

   <p>When you upgrade to a new Emacs version, you might want to customize
new options and options whose meanings or default values have changed. 
To do this, use <kbd>M-x customize-changed-options</kbd> and specify a
previous Emacs version number using the minibuffer.  It creates a
customization buffer which shows all the options (and groups) whose
definitions have been changed since the specified version.

   <p>If you change option values and then decide the change was a mistake,
you can use two special commands to revisit your previous changes.  Use
<kbd>M-x customize-saved</kbd> to look at the options and faces that you have
saved.  Use <kbd>M-x customize-customized</kbd> to look at the options and
faces that you have set but not saved.
