<p>Rmail has several commands that use Mail mode to send outgoing mail. 
See <a href="Sending-Mail.html#Sending%20Mail">Sending Mail</a>, for information on using Mail mode, including
certain features meant to work with Rmail.  What this section documents
are the special commands of Rmail for entering Mail mode.  Note that the
usual keys for sending mail--<kbd>C-x m</kbd>, <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd>, and <kbd>C-x 5
m</kbd>--are available in Rmail mode and work just as they usually do.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>m</kbd>
     <dd>Send a message (<code>rmail-mail</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>c</kbd>
     <dd>Continue editing the already started outgoing message (<code>rmail-continue</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>r</kbd>
     <dd>Send a reply to the current Rmail message (<code>rmail-reply</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>f</kbd>
     <dd>Forward the current message to other users (<code>rmail-forward</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-u f</kbd>
     <dd>Resend the current message to other users (<code>rmail-resend</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-m</kbd>
     <dd>Try sending a bounced message a second time (<code>rmail-retry-failure</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The most common reason to send a message while in Rmail is to reply to
the message you are reading.  To do this, type <kbd>r</kbd>
(<code>rmail-reply</code>).  This displays the <code>*mail*</code> buffer in another
window, much like <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd>, but preinitializes the <code>Subject</code>,
<code>To</code>, <code>CC</code> and <code>In-reply-to</code> header fields based on the
message you are replying to.  The <code>To</code> field starts out as the
address of the person who sent the message you received, and the
<code>CC</code> field starts out with all the other recipients of that
message.

   <p>You can exclude certain recipients from being placed automatically in
the <code>CC</code>, using the variable <code>rmail-dont-reply-to-names</code>.  Its
value should be a regular expression (as a string); any recipient that
the regular expression matches, is excluded from the <code>CC</code> field. 
The default value matches your own name, and any name starting with
<code>info-</code>.  (Those names are excluded because there is a convention
of using them for large mailing lists to broadcast announcements.)

   <p>To omit the <code>CC</code> field completely for a particular reply, enter
the reply command with a numeric argument: <kbd>C-u r</kbd> or <kbd>1 r</kbd>.

   <p>Once the <code>*mail*</code> buffer has been initialized, editing and
sending the mail goes as usual (see <a href="Sending-Mail.html#Sending%20Mail">Sending Mail</a>).  You can edit the
presupplied header fields if they are not right for you.  You can also
use the commands of Mail mode (see <a href="Mail-Mode.html#Mail%20Mode">Mail Mode</a>), including <kbd>C-c
C-y</kbd> which yanks in the message that you are replying to.  You can
switch to the Rmail buffer, select a different message there, switch
back, and yank the new current message.

   <p>Sometimes a message does not reach its destination.  Mailers usually
send the failed message back to you, enclosed in a <dfn>failure
message</dfn>.  The Rmail command <kbd>M-m</kbd> (<code>rmail-retry-failure</code>)
prepares to send the same message a second time: it sets up a
<code>*mail*</code> buffer with the same text and header fields as before.  If
you type <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> right away, you send the message again exactly
the same as the first time.  Alternatively, you can edit the text or
headers and then send it.  The variable
<code>rmail-retry-ignored-headers</code>, in the same format as
<code>rmail-ignored-headers</code> (see <a href="Rmail-Display.html#Rmail%20Display">Rmail Display</a>), controls which
headers are stripped from the failed message when retrying it.

   <p>Another frequent reason to send mail in Rmail is to <dfn>forward</dfn> the
current message to other users.  <kbd>f</kbd> (<code>rmail-forward</code>) makes
this easy by preinitializing the <code>*mail*</code> buffer with the current
message as the text, and a subject designating a forwarded message.  All
you have to do is fill in the recipients and send.  When you forward a
message, recipients get a message which is "from" you, and which has
the original message in its contents.

   <p>Forwarding a message encloses it between two delimiter lines.  It also
modifies every line that starts with a dash, by inserting <code>-&nbsp;</code>
at the start of the line.  When you receive a forwarded message, if it
contains something besides ordinary text--for example, program source
code--you might find it useful to undo that transformation.  You can do
this by selecting the forwarded message and typing <kbd>M-x
unforward-rmail-message</kbd>.  This command extracts the original forwarded
message, deleting the inserted <code>-&nbsp;</code> strings, and inserts it
into the Rmail file as a separate message immediately following the
current one.

   <p><dfn>Resending</dfn> is an alternative similar to forwarding; the
difference is that resending sends a message that is "from" the
original sender, just as it reached you--with a few added header fields
<code>Resent-From</code> and <code>Resent-To</code> to indicate that it came via
you.  To resend a message in Rmail, use <kbd>C-u f</kbd>.  (<kbd>f</kbd> runs
<code>rmail-forward</code>, which is programmed to invoke <code>rmail-resend</code>
if you provide a numeric argument.)

   <p>The <kbd>m</kbd> (<code>rmail-mail</code>) command is used to start editing an
outgoing message that is not a reply.  It leaves the header fields empty. 
Its only difference from <kbd>C-x 4 m</kbd> is that it makes the Rmail buffer
accessible for <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd>, just as <kbd>r</kbd> does.  Thus, <kbd>m</kbd> can be
used to reply to or forward a message; it can do anything <kbd>r</kbd> or <kbd>f</kbd>
can do.

   <p>The <kbd>c</kbd> (<code>rmail-continue</code>) command resumes editing the
<code>*mail*</code> buffer, to finish editing an outgoing message you were
already composing, or to alter a message you have sent.

   <p>If you set the variable <code>rmail-mail-new-frame</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value, then all the Rmail commands to start sending a
message create a new frame to edit it in.  This frame is deleted when
you send the message, or when you use the <code>Cancel</code> item in the
<code>Mail</code> menu.

   <p>All the Rmail commands to send a message use the mail-composition
method that you have chosen (see <a href="Mail-Methods.html#Mail%20Methods">Mail Methods</a>).
