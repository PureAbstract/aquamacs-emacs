<h3 class="section">Pages</h3>

<p>Files are often thought of as divided into <dfn>pages</dfn> by the
<dfn>formfeed</dfn> character (ASCII control-L, octal code 014).  When you
print hardcopy for a file, this character forces a page break; thus,
each page of the file goes on a separate page on paper.  Most Emacs
commands treat the page-separator character just like any other
character: you can insert it with <kbd>C-q C-l</kbd>, and delete it with
&lt;DEL&gt;.  Thus, you are free to paginate your file or not.  However,
since pages are often meaningful divisions of the file, Emacs provides
commands to move over them and operate on them.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x [</kbd>
     <dd>Move point to previous page boundary (<code>backward-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x ]</kbd>
     <dd>Move point to next page boundary (<code>forward-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x C-p</kbd>
     <dd>Put point and mark around this page (or another page) (<code>mark-page</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>C-x l</kbd>
     <dd>Count the lines in this page (<code>count-lines-page</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>The <kbd>C-x [</kbd> (<code>backward-page</code>) command moves point to immediately
after the previous page delimiter.  If point is already right after a page
delimiter, it skips that one and stops at the previous one.  A numeric
argument serves as a repeat count.  The <kbd>C-x ]</kbd> (<code>forward-page</code>)
command moves forward past the next page delimiter.

   <p>The <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> command (<code>mark-page</code>) puts point at the
beginning of the current page and the mark at the end.  The page
delimiter at the end is included (the mark follows it).  The page
delimiter at the front is excluded (point follows it).  In Transient
Mark mode, this command activates the mark.

   <p><kbd>C-x C-p C-w</kbd> is a handy way to kill a page to move it
elsewhere.  If you move to another page delimiter with <kbd>C-x [</kbd> and
<kbd>C-x ]</kbd>, then yank the killed page, all the pages will be properly
delimited once again.  The reason <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> includes only the
following page delimiter in the region is to ensure that.

   <p>A numeric argument to <kbd>C-x C-p</kbd> is used to specify which page to go
to, relative to the current one.  Zero means the current page.  One means
the next page, and -1 means the previous one.

   <p>The <kbd>C-x l</kbd> command (<code>count-lines-page</code>) is good for deciding
where to break a page in two.  It displays in the echo area the total number
of lines in the current page, and then divides it up into those preceding
the current line and those following, as in

<pre class="example">     Page has 96 (72+25) lines
     </pre>

<p>Notice that the sum is off by one; this is correct if point is not at the
beginning of a line.

   <p>The variable <code>page-delimiter</code> controls where pages begin.  Its
value is a regexp that matches the beginning of a line that separates
pages.  The normal value of this variable is <code>"^\f"</code>, which
matches a formfeed character at the beginning of a line.
