<h3 class="section">Two-Column Editing</h3>

<p>Two-column mode lets you conveniently edit two side-by-side columns of
text.  It uses two side-by-side windows, each showing its own
buffer.

   <p>There are three ways to enter two-column mode:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>&lt;F2&gt; 2</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 2</kbd>
     <dd>Enter two-column mode with the current buffer on the left, and on the
right, a buffer whose name is based on the current buffer's name
(<code>2C-two-columns</code>).  If the right-hand buffer doesn't already
exist, it starts out empty; the current buffer's contents are not
changed.

     <p>This command is appropriate when the current buffer is empty or contains
just one column and you want to add another column.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 s</kbd>
     <dd>Split the current buffer, which contains two-column text, into two
buffers, and display them side by side (<code>2C-split</code>).  The current
buffer becomes the left-hand buffer, but the text in the right-hand
column is moved into the right-hand buffer.  The current column
specifies the split point.  Splitting starts with the current line and
continues to the end of the buffer.

     <p>This command is appropriate when you have a buffer that already contains
two-column text, and you wish to separate the columns temporarily.

     <br><dt><kbd>&lt;F2&gt; b </kbd><var>buffer</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd><dt><kbd>C-x 6 b </kbd><var>buffer</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Enter two-column mode using the current buffer as the left-hand buffer,
and using buffer <var>buffer</var> as the right-hand buffer
(<code>2C-associate-buffer</code>). 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 s</kbd> looks for a column separator, which
is a string that appears on each line between the two columns.  You can
specify the width of the separator with a numeric argument to
<kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd>; that many characters, before point, constitute the
separator string.  By default, the width is 1, so the column separator
is the character before point.

   <p>When a line has the separator at the proper place, <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd>
puts the text after the separator into the right-hand buffer, and
deletes the separator.  Lines that don't have the column separator at
the proper place remain unsplit; they stay in the left-hand buffer, and
the right-hand buffer gets an empty line to correspond.  (This is the
way to write a line that "spans both columns while in two-column
mode": write it in the left-hand buffer, and put an empty line in the
right-hand buffer.)

   <p>The command <kbd>C-x 6 &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
(<code>2C-newline</code>) inserts a newline in each of the two buffers at
corresponding positions.  This is the easiest way to add a new line to
the two-column text while editing it in split buffers.

   <p>When you have edited both buffers as you wish, merge them with
<kbd>&lt;F2&gt; 1</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 1</kbd> (<code>2C-merge</code>).  This copies the
text from the right-hand buffer as a second column in the other buffer. 
To go back to two-column editing, use <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; s</kbd>.

   <p>Use <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; d</kbd> or <kbd>C-x 6 d</kbd> to dissociate the two buffers,
leaving each as it stands (<code>2C-dissociate</code>).  If the other buffer,
the one not current when you type <kbd>&lt;F2&gt; d</kbd>, is empty,
<kbd>&lt;F2&gt; d</kbd> kills it.
