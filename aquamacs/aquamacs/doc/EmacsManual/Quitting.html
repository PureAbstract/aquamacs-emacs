   <p>There are two ways of canceling commands which are not finished
executing: <dfn>quitting</dfn> with <kbd>C-g</kbd>, and <dfn>aborting</dfn> with
<kbd>C-]</kbd> or <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd>.  Quitting cancels a partially typed
command or one which is already running.  Aborting exits a recursive
editing level and cancels the command that invoked the recursive edit. 
(See <a href="Recursive-Edit.html#Recursive%20Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.)

   <p>Quitting with <kbd>C-g</kbd> is used for getting rid of a partially typed
command, or a numeric argument that you don't want.  It also stops a
running command in the middle in a relatively safe way, so you can use
it if you accidentally give a command which takes a long time.  In
particular, it is safe to quit out of killing; either your text will
<em>all</em> still be in the buffer, or it will <em>all</em> be in the kill
ring (or maybe both).  Quitting an incremental search does special
things documented under searching; in general, it may take two
successive <kbd>C-g</kbd> characters to get out of a search
(see <a href="Incremental-Search.html#Incremental%20Search">Incremental Search</a>).

   <p>On MS-DOS, the character <kbd>C-&lt;BREAK&gt;</kbd> serves as a quit character
like <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  The reason is that it is not feasible, on MS-DOS, to
recognize <kbd>C-g</kbd> while a command is running, between interactions
with the user.  By contrast, it <em>is</em> feasible to recognize
<kbd>C-&lt;BREAK&gt;</kbd> at all times.  See <a href="MS-DOS-Input.html#MS-DOS%20Input">MS-DOS Input</a>.

   <p><kbd>C-g</kbd> works by setting the variable <code>quit-flag</code> to <code>t</code>
the instant <kbd>C-g</kbd> is typed; Emacs Lisp checks this variable
frequently and quits if it is non-<code>nil</code>.  <kbd>C-g</kbd> is only
actually executed as a command if you type it while Emacs is waiting for
input.  In that case, the command it runs is <code>keyboard-quit</code>.

   <p>If you quit with <kbd>C-g</kbd> a second time before the first <kbd>C-g</kbd> is
recognized, you activate the "emergency escape" feature and return to
the shell.  See <a href="Emergency-Escape.html#Emergency%20Escape">Emergency Escape</a>.

   <p>There may be times when you cannot quit.  When Emacs is waiting for
the operating system to do something, quitting is impossible unless
special pains are taken for the particular system call within Emacs
where the waiting occurs.  We have done this for the system calls that
users are likely to want to quit from, but it's possible you will find
another.  In one very common case--waiting for file input or output
using NFS--Emacs itself knows how to quit, but many NFS implementations
simply do not allow user programs to stop waiting for NFS when the NFS
server is hung.

   <p>Aborting with <kbd>C-]</kbd> (<code>abort-recursive-edit</code>) is used to get
out of a recursive editing level and cancel the command which invoked
it.  Quitting with <kbd>C-g</kbd> does not do this, and could not do this,
because it is used to cancel a partially typed command <em>within</em> the
recursive editing level.  Both operations are useful.  For example, if
you are in a recursive edit and type <kbd>C-u 8</kbd> to enter a numeric
argument, you can cancel that argument with <kbd>C-g</kbd> and remain in the
recursive edit.

   <p>The command <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>
(<code>keyboard-escape-quit</code>) can either quit or abort.  This key was
defined because &lt;ESC&gt; is used to "get out" in many PC programs. 
It can cancel a prefix argument, clear a selected region, or get out of
a Query Replace, like <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  It can get out of the minibuffer or a
recursive edit, like <kbd>C-]</kbd>.  It can also get out of splitting the
frame into multiple windows, like <kbd>C-x 1</kbd>.  One thing it cannot do,
however, is stop a command that is running.  That's because it executes
as an ordinary command, and Emacs doesn't notice it until it is ready
for a command.

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x top-level</kbd> is equivalent to "enough" <kbd>C-]</kbd>
commands to get you out of all the levels of recursive edits that you
are in.  <kbd>C-]</kbd> gets you out one level at a time, but <kbd>M-x
top-level</kbd> goes out all levels at once.  Both <kbd>C-]</kbd> and <kbd>M-x
top-level</kbd> are like all other commands, and unlike <kbd>C-g</kbd>, in that
they take effect only when Emacs is ready for a command.  <kbd>C-]</kbd> is
an ordinary key and has its meaning only because of its binding in the
keymap.  See <a href="Recursive-Edit.html#Recursive%20Edit">Recursive Edit</a>.

   <p><kbd>C-x u</kbd> (<code>undo</code>) is not strictly speaking a way of canceling
a command, but you can think of it as canceling a command that already
finished executing.  See <a href="Undo.html#Undo">Undo</a>, for more information
about the undo facility.
