<h3 class="subsection">Man Page Lookup</h4>

<p>On Unix, the main form of on-line documentation was the <dfn>manual
page</dfn> or <dfn>man page</dfn>.  In the GNU operating system, we hope to
replace man pages with better-organized manuals that you can browse
with Info (see <a href="Misc-Help.html#Misc%20Help">Misc Help</a>).  This process is not finished, so it is
still useful to read manual pages.

   <p>You can read the man page for an operating system command, library
function, or system call, with the <kbd>M-x manual-entry</kbd> command.  It
runs the <code>man</code> program to format the man page; if the system
permits, it runs <code>man</code> asynchronously, so that you can keep on
editing while the page is being formatted.  (On MS-DOS and MS-Windows
3, you cannot edit while Emacs waits for <code>man</code> to finish.)  The
result goes in a buffer named <code>*Man </code><var>topic</var><code>*</code>.  These buffers
use a special major mode, Man mode, that facilitates scrolling and
jumping to other manual pages.  For details, type <kbd>C-h m</kbd> while in
a man page buffer.

   <p>Each man page belongs to one of ten or more <dfn>sections</dfn>, each
named by a digit or by a digit and a letter.  Sometimes there are
multiple man pages with the same name in different sections.  To read
a man page from a specific section, type
<code></code><var>topic</var><code>(</code><var>section</var><code>)</code> or <code></code><var>section</var><code> </code><var>topic</var><code></code>
when <kbd>M-x manual-entry</kbd> prompts for the topic.  For example, to
read the man page for the C library function <code>chmod</code> (as opposed
to a command of the same name), type <kbd>M-x manual-entry &lt;RET&gt;
chmod(2) &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> (<code>chmod</code> is a system call, so it is in
section <code>2</code>).

   <p>If you do not specify a section, the results depend on how the
<code>man</code> program works on your system.  Some of them display only
the first man page they find.  Others display all man pages that have
the specified name, so you can move between them with the <kbd>M-n</kbd>
and <kbd>M-p</kbd> keys<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
The mode line shows how many manual pages are present in the Man buffer.

   <p>By default, Emacs highlights the text in man pages.  For a long man
page, highlighting can take substantial time.  You can turn off
highlighting of man pages by setting the variable
<code>Man-fontify-manpage-flag</code> to <code>nil</code>.

   <p>If you insert the text of a man page into an Emacs buffer in some
other fashion, you can use the command <kbd>M-x Man-fontify-manpage</kbd> to
perform the same conversions that <kbd>M-x manual-entry</kbd> does.

   <p>An alternative way of reading manual pages is the <kbd>M-x woman</kbd>
command<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  Unlike <kbd>M-x man</kbd>, it does not run any external
programs to format and display the man pages; instead it does the job
in Emacs Lisp, so it works on systems such as MS-Windows, where the
<code>man</code> program (and the other programs it uses) are not generally
available.

   <p><kbd>M-x woman</kbd> prompts for a name of a manual page, and provides
completion based on the list of manual pages that are installed on
your machine; the list of available manual pages is computed
automatically the first time you invoke <code>woman</code>.  The word at
point in the current buffer is used to suggest the default for the
name the manual page.

   <p>With a numeric argument, <kbd>M-x woman</kbd> recomputes the list of the
manual pages used for completion.  This is useful if you add or delete
manual pages.

   <p>If you type a name of a manual page and <kbd>M-x woman</kbd> finds that
several manual pages by the same name exist in different sections, it
pops up a window with possible candidates asking you to choose one of
them.

   <p>By default, <kbd>M-x woman</kbd> looks for manual pages in the
directories specified in the <code>MANPATH</code> environment variable.  (If
<code>MANPATH</code> is not set, <code>woman</code> uses a suitable default value,
which can be customized.)  More precisely, <code>woman</code> looks for
subdirectories that match the shell wildcard pattern <code>man*</code> in each one
of these directories, and tries to find the manual pages in those
subdirectories.  When first invoked, <kbd>M-x woman</kbd> converts the
value of <code>MANPATH</code> to a list of directory names and stores that
list in the <code>woman-manpath</code> variable.  Changing the value of this
variable is another way to control the list of directories used.

   <p>You can also augment the list of directories searched by
<code>woman</code> by setting the value of the <code>woman-path</code> variable. 
This variable should hold a list of specific directories which
<code>woman</code> should search, in addition to those in
<code>woman-manpath</code>.  Unlike <code>woman-manpath</code>, the directories in
<code>woman-path</code> are searched for the manual pages, not for
<code>man*</code> subdirectories.

   <p>Occasionally, you might need to display manual pages that are not in
any of the directories listed by <code>woman-manpath</code> and
<code>woman-path</code>.  The <kbd>M-x woman-find-file</kbd> command prompts for a
name of a manual page file, with completion, and then formats and
displays that file like <kbd>M-x woman</kbd> does.

   <p>The first time you invoke <kbd>M-x woman</kbd>, it defines the Dired
<kbd>W</kbd> key to run the <code>woman-find-file</code> command on the current
line's file.  You can disable this by setting the variable
<code>woman-dired-keys</code> to <code>nil</code>.  See <a href="Dired.html#Dired">Dired</a>.  In addition,
the Tar-mode <kbd>w</kbd> key is define to invoke <code>woman-find-file</code> on
the current line's archive member.

   <p>For more information about setting up and using <kbd>M-x woman</kbd>, see

<h4>Footnotes</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>On some systems, the <code>man</code> program
accepts a <code>-a</code> command-line option which tells it to display all
the man pages for the specified topic.  If you want this behavior, you
can add this option to the value of the variable <code>Man-switches</code>.</p>

   <li><a name="fn-2"></a>
<p>The name of the command, <code>woman</code>, is an acronym
for ``w/o (without) man,'' since it doesn't use the <code>man</code>
program.</p>
