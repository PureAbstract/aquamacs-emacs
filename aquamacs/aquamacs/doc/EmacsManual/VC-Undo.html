     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x v u</kbd>
     <dd>Revert the buffer and the file to the last checked-in version.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-x v c</kbd>
     <dd>Remove the last-entered change from the master for the visited file. 
This undoes your last check-in. 
</dl>

   <p>If you want to discard your current set of changes and revert to the
last version checked in, use <kbd>C-x v u</kbd> (<code>vc-revert-buffer</code>). 
This leaves the file unlocked; if locking is in use, you must first lock
the file again before you change it again.  <kbd>C-x v u</kbd> requires
confirmation, unless it sees that you haven't made any changes since the
last checked-in version.

   <p><kbd>C-x v u</kbd> is also the command to unlock a file if you lock it and
then decide not to change it.

   <p>To cancel a change that you already checked in, use <kbd>C-x v c</kbd>
(<code>vc-cancel-version</code>).  This command discards all record of the
most recent checked-in version.  <kbd>C-x v c</kbd> also offers to revert
your work file and buffer to the previous version (the one that precedes
the version that is deleted).

   <p>If you answer <kbd>no</kbd>, VC keeps your changes in the buffer, and locks
the file.  The no-revert option is useful when you have checked in a
change and then discover a trivial error in it; you can cancel the
erroneous check-in, fix the error, and check the file in again.

   <p>When <kbd>C-x v c</kbd> does not revert the buffer, it unexpands all
version control headers in the buffer instead (see <a href="Version-Headers.html#Version%20Headers">Version Headers</a>). 
This is because the buffer no longer corresponds to any existing
version.  If you check it in again, the check-in process will expand the
headers properly for the new version number.

   <p>However, it is impossible to unexpand the RCS <code>$Log: VC-Undo.html,v $

   <p>However, it is impossible to unexpand the RCS <code></code> header
automatically.  If you use that header feature, you have to unexpand it
by hand--by deleting the entry for the version that you just canceled.

   <p>Be careful when invoking <kbd>C-x v c</kbd>, as it is easy to lose a lot of
work with it.  To help you be careful, this command always requires
confirmation with <kbd>yes</kbd>.  Note also that this command is disabled
under CVS, because canceling versions is very dangerous and discouraged
with CVS.
