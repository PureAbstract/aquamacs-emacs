<h3 class="section">Dynamic Abbrev Expansion</h3>

<p>The abbrev facility described above operates automatically as you insert
text, but all abbrevs must be defined explicitly.  By contrast,
<dfn>dynamic abbrevs</dfn> allow the meanings of abbrevs to be determined
automatically from the contents of the buffer, but dynamic abbrev expansion
happens only when you request it explicitly.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>M-/</kbd>
     <dd>Expand the word in the buffer before point as a <dfn>dynamic abbrev</dfn>,
by searching in the buffer for words starting with that abbreviation
(<code>dabbrev-expand</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-M-/</kbd>
     <dd>Complete the word before point as a dynamic abbrev
(<code>dabbrev-completion</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>For example, if the buffer contains <code>does this follow </code> and you
type <kbd>f o M-/</kbd>, the effect is to insert <code>follow</code> because that
is the last word in the buffer that starts with <code>fo</code>.  A numeric
argument to <kbd>M-/</kbd> says to take the second, third, etc. distinct
expansion found looking backward from point.  Repeating <kbd>M-/</kbd>
searches for an alternative expansion by looking farther back.  After
scanning all the text before point, it searches the text after point. 
The variable <code>dabbrev-limit</code>, if non-<code>nil</code>, specifies how far
in the buffer to search for an expansion.

   <p>After scanning the current buffer, <kbd>M-/</kbd> normally searches other
buffers, unless you have set <code>dabbrev-check-all-buffers</code> to
<code>nil</code>.

   <p>For finer control over which buffers to scan, customize the variable
<code>dabbrev-ignored-buffer-regexps</code>.  Its value is a list of regular
expressions.  If a buffer's name matches any of these regular
expressions, dynamic abbrev expansion skips that buffer.

   <p>A negative argument to <kbd>M-/</kbd>, as in <kbd>C-u - M-/</kbd>, says to
search first for expansions after point, and second for expansions
before point.  If you repeat the <kbd>M-/</kbd> to look for another
expansion, do not specify an argument.  This tries all the expansions
after point and then the expansions before point.

   <p>After you have expanded a dynamic abbrev, you can copy additional
words that follow the expansion in its original context.  Simply type
<kbd>&lt;SPC&gt; M-/</kbd> for each word you want to copy.  The spacing and
punctuation between words is copied along with the words.

   <p>The command <kbd>C-M-/</kbd> (<code>dabbrev-completion</code>) performs
completion of a dynamic abbreviation.  Instead of trying the possible
expansions one by one, it finds all of them, then inserts the text that
they have in common.  If they have nothing in common, <kbd>C-M-/</kbd>
displays a list of completions, from which you can select a choice in
the usual manner.  See <a href="Completion.html#Completion">Completion</a>.

   <p>Dynamic abbrev expansion is completely independent of Abbrev mode; the
expansion of a word with <kbd>M-/</kbd> is completely independent of whether
it has a definition as an ordinary abbrev.
