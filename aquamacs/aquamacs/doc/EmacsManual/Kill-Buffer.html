<h3 class="section">Killing Buffers</h3>

<p>If you continue an Emacs session for a while, you may accumulate a
large number of buffers.  You may then find it convenient to <dfn>kill</dfn>
the buffers you no longer need.  On most operating systems, killing a
buffer releases its space back to the operating system so that other
programs can use it.  Here are some commands for killing buffers:

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-x k </kbd><var>bufname</var><kbd> &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
     <dd>Kill buffer <var>bufname</var> (<code>kill-buffer</code>). 
<br><dt><kbd>M-x kill-some-buffers</kbd>
     <dd>Offer to kill each buffer, one by one. 
</dl>

   <p><kbd>C-x k</kbd> (<code>kill-buffer</code>) kills one buffer, whose name you
specify in the minibuffer.  The default, used if you type just
&lt;RET&gt; in the minibuffer, is to kill the current buffer.  If you
kill the current buffer, another buffer becomes current: one that was
current in the recent past but is not displayed in any window now.  If
you ask to kill a file-visiting buffer that is modified (has unsaved
editing), then you must confirm with <kbd>yes</kbd> before the buffer is
killed.

   <p>The command <kbd>M-x kill-some-buffers</kbd> asks about each buffer, one by
one.  An answer of <kbd>y</kbd> means to kill the buffer.  Killing the current
buffer or a buffer containing unsaved changes selects a new buffer or asks
for confirmation just like <code>kill-buffer</code>.

   <p>The buffer menu feature (see <a href="Several-Buffers.html#Several%20Buffers">Several Buffers</a>) is also convenient
for killing various buffers.

   <p>If you want to do something special every time a buffer is killed, you
can add hook functions to the hook <code>kill-buffer-hook</code> (see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p>If you run one Emacs session for a period of days, as many people do,
it can fill up with buffers that you used several days ago.  The command
<kbd>M-x clean-buffer-list</kbd> is a convenient way to purge them; it kills
all the unmodified buffers that you have not used for a long time.  An
ordinary buffer is killed if it has not been displayed for three days;
however, you can specify certain buffers that should never be killed
automatically, and others that should be killed if they have been unused
for a mere hour.

   <p>You can also have this buffer purging done for you, every day at
midnight, by enabling Midnight mode.  Midnight mode operates each day at
midnight; at that time, it runs <code>clean-buffer-list</code>, or whichever
functions you have placed in the normal hook <code>midnight-hook</code>
(see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>).

   <p>To enable Midnight mode, use the Customization buffer to set the
variable <code>midnight-mode</code> to <code>t</code>.  See <a href="Easy-Customization.html#Easy%20Customization">Easy Customization</a>.
