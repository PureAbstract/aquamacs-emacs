<h3 class="section">Keyboard and Mouse on MS-DOS</h3>

<p>The PC keyboard maps use the left &lt;ALT&gt; key as the &lt;META&gt; key. 
You have two choices for emulating the &lt;SUPER&gt; and &lt;HYPER&gt; keys:
choose either the right &lt;CTRL&gt; key or the right &lt;ALT&gt; key by
setting the variables <code>dos-hyper-key</code> and <code>dos-super-key</code> to 1
or 2 respectively.  If neither <code>dos-super-key</code> nor
<code>dos-hyper-key</code> is 1, then by default the right &lt;ALT&gt; key is
also mapped to the &lt;META&gt; key.  However, if the MS-DOS international
keyboard support program <code>KEYB.COM</code> is installed, Emacs will
<em>not</em> map the right &lt;ALT&gt; to &lt;META&gt;, since it is used for
accessing characters like <kbd>~</kbd> and <kbd>@</kbd> on non-US keyboard
layouts; in this case, you may only use the left &lt;ALT&gt; as &lt;META&gt;
key.

   <p>The variable <code>dos-keypad-mode</code> is a flag variable that controls
what key codes are returned by keys in the numeric keypad.  You can also
define the keypad &lt;ENTER&gt; key to act like <kbd>C-j</kbd>, by putting the
following line into your <code>_emacs</code> file:

<pre class="smallexample">     ;; Make the &lt;ENTER&gt; key from the numeric keypad act as <kbd>C-j</kbd>.
     (define-key function-key-map [kp-enter] [?\C-j])
     </pre>

   <p>The key that is called &lt;DEL&gt; in Emacs (because that's how it is
designated on most workstations) is known as &lt;BS&gt; (backspace) on a
PC.  That is why the PC-specific terminal initialization remaps the
&lt;BS&gt; key to act as &lt;DEL&gt;; the &lt;DEL&gt; key is remapped to act
as <kbd>C-d</kbd> for the same reasons.

   <p>Emacs built for MS-DOS recognizes <kbd>C-&lt;BREAK&gt;</kbd> as a quit
character, just like <kbd>C-g</kbd>.  This is because Emacs cannot detect
that you have typed <kbd>C-g</kbd> until it is ready for more input.  As a
consequence, you cannot use <kbd>C-g</kbd> to stop a running command
(see <a href="Quitting.html#Quitting">Quitting</a>).  By contrast, <kbd>C-&lt;BREAK&gt;</kbd> <em>is</em> detected
as soon as you type it (as <kbd>C-g</kbd> is on other systems), so it can be
used to stop a running command and for emergency escape
(see <a href="Emergency-Escape.html#Emergency%20Escape">Emergency Escape</a>).

   <p>Emacs on MS-DOS supports a mouse (on the default terminal only). 
The mouse commands work as documented, including those that use menus
and the menu bar (see <a href="Menu-Bar.html#Menu%20Bar">Menu Bar</a>).  Scroll bars don't work in
MS-DOS Emacs.  PC mice usually have only two buttons; these act as
<kbd>Mouse-1</kbd> and <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd>, but if you press both of them
together, that has the effect of <kbd>Mouse-3</kbd>.  If the mouse does have
3 buttons, Emacs detects that at startup, and all the 3 buttons function
normally, as on X.

   <p>Help strings for menu-bar and pop-up menus are displayed in the echo
area when the mouse pointer moves across the menu items. 
Highlighting of mouse-sensitive text (see <a href="Mouse-References.html#Mouse%20References">Mouse References</a>) is also
supported.

   <p>Some versions of mouse drivers don't report the number of mouse
buttons correctly.  For example, mice with a wheel report that they
have 3 buttons, but only 2 of them are passed to Emacs; the clicks on
the wheel, which serves as the middle button, are not passed.  In
these cases, you can use the <kbd>M-x msdos-set-mouse-buttons</kbd> command
to tell Emacs how many mouse buttons to expect.  You could make such a
setting permanent by adding this fragment to your <code>_emacs</code> init
file:

<pre class="example">     ;; Treat the mouse like a 2-button mouse.
     (msdos-set-mouse-buttons 2)
     </pre>

   <p>Emacs built for MS-DOS supports clipboard operations when it runs on
Windows.  Commands that put text on the kill ring, or yank text from the
ring, check the Windows clipboard first, just as Emacs does on the X
Window System (see <a href="Mouse-Commands.html#Mouse%20Commands">Mouse Commands</a>).  Only the primary selection and
the cut buffer are supported by MS-DOS Emacs on Windows; the secondary
selection always appears as empty.

   <p>Due to the way clipboard access is implemented by Windows, the
length of text you can put into the clipboard is limited by the amount
of free DOS memory that is available to Emacs.  Usually, up to 620KB of
text can be put into the clipboard, but this limit depends on the system
configuration and is lower if you run Emacs as a subprocess of
another program.  If the killed text does not fit, Emacs outputs a
message saying so, and does not put the text into the clipboard.

   <p>Null characters also cannot be put into the Windows clipboard.  If the
killed text includes null characters, Emacs does not put such text into
the clipboard, and displays in the echo area a message to that effect.

   <p>The variable <code>dos-display-scancodes</code>, when non-<code>nil</code>,
directs Emacs to display the ASCII value and the keyboard scan code of
each keystroke; this feature serves as a complement to the
<code>view-lossage</code> command, for debugging.
