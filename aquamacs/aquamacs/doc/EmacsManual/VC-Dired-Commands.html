<h3 class="subsubsection">VC Dired Commands</h5>

<p>All the usual Dired commands work normally in VC Dired mode, except
for <kbd>v</kbd>, which is redefined as the version control prefix.  You can
invoke VC commands such as <code>vc-diff</code> and <code>vc-print-log</code> by
typing <kbd>v =</kbd>, or <kbd>v l</kbd>, and so on.  Most of these commands apply
to the file name on the current line.

   <p>The command <kbd>v v</kbd> (<code>vc-next-action</code>) operates on all the
marked files, so that you can lock or check in several files at once. 
If it operates on more than one file, it handles each file according to
its current state; thus, it might lock one file, but check in another
file.  This could be confusing; it is up to you to avoid confusing
behavior by marking a set of files that are in a similar state.

   <p>If any files call for check-in, <kbd>v v</kbd> reads a single log entry,
then uses it for all the files being checked in.  This is convenient for
registering or checking in several files at once, as part of the same
change.

   <p>You can toggle between terse display (only locked files, or files not
up-to-date) and full display at any time by typing <kbd>v t</kbd>
(<code>vc-dired-toggle-terse-mode</code>).  There is also a special command
<kbd>* l</kbd> (<code>vc-dired-mark-locked</code>), which marks all files currently
locked (or, with CVS, all files not up-to-date).  Thus, typing <kbd>* l
t k</kbd> is another way to delete from the buffer all files except those
currently locked.
