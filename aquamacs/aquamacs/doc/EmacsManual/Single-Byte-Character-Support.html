<h3 class="section">Single-byte Character Set Support</h3>

<p>The ISO 8859 Latin-<var>n</var> character sets define character codes in
the range 0240 to 0377 octal (160 to 255 decimal) to handle the
accented letters and punctuation needed by various European languages
(and some non-European ones).  If you disable multibyte characters,
Emacs can still handle <em>one</em> of these character codes at a time. 
To specify <em>which</em> of these codes to use, invoke <kbd>M-x
set-language-environment</kbd> and specify a suitable language environment
such as <code>Latin-</code><var>n</var><code></code>.

   <p>For more information about unibyte operation, see <a href="Enabling-Multibyte.html#Enabling%20Multibyte">Enabling Multibyte</a>.  Note particularly that you probably want to ensure that
your initialization files are read as unibyte if they contain non-ASCII
characters.

   <p>Emacs can also display those characters, provided the terminal or font
in use supports them.  This works automatically.  Alternatively, if you
are using a window system, Emacs can also display single-byte characters
through fontsets, in effect by displaying the equivalent multibyte
characters according to the current language environment.  To request
this, set the variable <code>unibyte-display-via-language-environment</code>
to a non-<code>nil</code> value.

   <p>If your terminal does not support display of the Latin-1 character
set, Emacs can display these characters as ASCII sequences which at
least give you a clear idea of what the characters are.  To do this,
load the library <code>iso-ascii</code>.  Similar libraries for other
Latin-<var>n</var> character sets could be implemented, but we don't have
them yet.

   <p>Normally non-ISO-8859 characters (decimal codes between 128 and 159
inclusive) are displayed as octal escapes.  You can change this for
non-standard "extended" versions of ISO-8859 character sets by using the
function <code>standard-display-8bit</code> in the <code>disp-table</code> library.

   <p>There are several ways you can input single-byte non-ASCII
characters:

     <ul>
<li>If your keyboard can generate character codes 128 (decimal) and up,
representing non-ASCII characters, you can type those character codes
directly.

     <p>On a windowing terminal, you should not need to do anything special to
use these keys; they should simply work.  On a text-only terminal, you
should use the command <code>M-x set-keyboard-coding-system</code> or the
Custom option <code>keyboard-coding-system</code> to specify which coding
system your keyboard uses (see <a href="Specify-Coding.html#Specify%20Coding">Specify Coding</a>).  Enabling this
feature will probably require you to use <kbd>ESC</kbd> to type Meta
characters; however, on a Linux console or in <code>xterm</code>, you can
arrange for Meta to be converted to <kbd>ESC</kbd> and still be able type
8-bit characters present directly on the keyboard or using
<kbd>Compose</kbd> or <kbd>AltGr</kbd> keys.  See <a href="User-Input.html#User%20Input">User Input</a>.

     </p><li>You can use an input method for the selected language environment. 
See <a href="Input-Methods.html#Input%20Methods">Input Methods</a>.  When you use an input method in a unibyte buffer,
the non-ASCII character you specify with it is converted to unibyte.

     <li>For Latin-1 only, you can use the
key <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> as a "compose character" prefix for entry of
non-ASCII Latin-1 printing characters.  <kbd>C-x 8</kbd> is good for
insertion (in the minibuffer as well as other buffers), for searching,
and in any other context where a key sequence is allowed.

     <p><kbd>C-x 8</kbd> works by loading the <code>iso-transl</code> library.  Once that
library is loaded, the &lt;ALT&gt; modifier key, if you have one, serves
the same purpose as <kbd>C-x 8</kbd>; use &lt;ALT&gt; together with an accent
character to modify the following letter.  In addition, if you have keys
for the Latin-1 "dead accent characters," they too are defined to
compose with the following character, once <code>iso-transl</code> is loaded. 
Use <kbd>C-x 8 C-h</kbd> to list the available translations as mnemonic
command names.

     <li>For Latin-1, Latin-2 and Latin-3, <kbd>M-x iso-accents-mode</kbd> enables
a minor mode that works much like the <code>latin-1-prefix</code> input
method, but does not depend on having the input methods installed.  This
mode is buffer-local.  It can be customized for various languages with
<kbd>M-x iso-accents-customize</kbd>. 
</ul>
