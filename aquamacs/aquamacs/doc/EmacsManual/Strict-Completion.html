<h3 class="subsection">Strict Completion</h4>

<p>There are three different ways that &lt;RET&gt; can work in completing
minibuffers, depending on how the argument will be used.

     <ul>
<li><dfn>Strict</dfn> completion is used when it is meaningless to give any
argument except one of the known alternatives.  For example, when
<kbd>C-x k</kbd> reads the name of a buffer to kill, it is meaningless to
give anything but the name of an existing buffer.  In strict
completion, &lt;RET&gt; refuses to exit if the text in the minibuffer
does not complete to an exact match.

     <li><dfn>Cautious</dfn> completion is similar to strict completion, except that
&lt;RET&gt; exits only if the text was an exact match already, not
needing completion.  If the text is not an exact match, &lt;RET&gt; does
not exit, but it does complete the text.  If it completes to an exact
match, a second &lt;RET&gt; will exit.

     <p>Cautious completion is used for reading file names for files that must
already exist.

     </p><li><dfn>Permissive</dfn> completion is used when any string whatever is
meaningful, and the list of completion alternatives is just a guide. 
For example, when <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> reads the name of a file to visit, any
file name is allowed, in case you want to create a file.  In
permissive completion, &lt;RET&gt; takes the text in the minibuffer
exactly as given, without completing it. 
</ul>

   <p>The completion commands display a list of all possible completions in
a window whenever there is more than one possibility for the very next
character.  Also, typing <kbd>?</kbd> explicitly requests such a list.  If
the list of completions is long, you can scroll it with <kbd>C-M-v</kbd>
(see <a href="Other-Window.html#Other%20Window">Other Window</a>).
