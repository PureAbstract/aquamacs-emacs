The macfns-dialog-menu patch originated in the MacEmacs JP project and
has been slightly extended for Aquamacs.

The mac-modifier-keys patch is not included in Aquamacs any more,
because it has since been applied to the main Emacs head CVS.

The emacs-inline patch was developed by HASHIMOTO Taiichi
<taiichi2@mac.com>.
